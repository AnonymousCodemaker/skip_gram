On 10 December 1982 , the General Assembly adopted resolution 37 / 90 in which it endorsed the recommendations of the Second United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space .
In that resolution , the Assembly decided , inter alia , that the United Nations Programme on Space Applications should disseminate , through panel meetings and seminars , information on new and advanced technology and applications , with emphasis on their relevance and implications for developing countries .
The United Nations / European Space Agency Workshop on Applications of Space Techniques to Prevent and Combat Natural Disasters was one of the activities of the Programme for 1995 that were endorsed by the General Assembly in its resolution 49 / 34 of 9 December 1994 .
The Workshop was organized in cooperation with the Government of Zimbabwe .
It was hosted by the Environment and Remote Sensing Institute ( ERSI ) and held at Harare , from 22 to 26 May 1995 , for participants from developing countries of the region covered by the Economic Commission for Africa ( ECA ) .
The objectives of the Workshop were ( a ) to expose the participants , particularly managers of emergency response agencies , to ways and means of utilizing space technology ( remote sensing , satellite meteorology , satellite communications , positioning by satellites ) to prevent or mitigate the effects of natural disasters ; and ( b ) to address the development of databases and their use with Geographic Information Systems ( GIS ) to prevent disasters or to monitor , mitigate and redress the effects of disasters when they occur .
The presentations to the Workshop covered the use of remote sensing , satellite meteorology , satellite positioning systems and satellite communications and how they could be used , separately or collectively , to prevent disasters or to forecast , monitor and mitigate the effects of severe weather phenomena , such as flooding , desertification and drought .
The presentations also addressed the extent to which the same technologies could mitigate the effects of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions .
The Workshop concluded with discussions on the needs of the emergency response services , the capabilities of space technology to satisfy those needs and the actions that would be necessary in the short- and medium-term to take advantage of those capabilities .
The participants will report to the appropriate authorities in their own countries .
B. Organization and programme of the Workshop The participants were professionals with several years experience in managerial positions with national and regional emergency response agencies and services .
Other participants had several years experience in remote sensing , satellite meteorology and the use of databases such as GIS .
Sixty-nine experts from 18 States Members of the United Nations and eight international and regional organizations participated in the Workshop ; 44 participants represented 14 developing countries from the ECA region .
The Workshop was attended by participants from the following countries and international organizations : Benin , Botswana , Egypt , Ethiopia , Ghana , Kenya , Malawi , Nigeria , South Africa , Sudan , United Republic of Tanzania , Zambia and Zimbabwe .
Presentations were made by experts from Ghana , France , Japan , Norway , South Africa , United Republic of Tanzania , United States of America and Zimbabwe ; from European Space Agency ( ESA ) , International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies ( regional delegation for Southern Africa ) , International Mobile Satellite Organization ( Inmarsat ) , International Telecommunications Satellite Organization ( INTELSAT ) , Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) , Department of Humanitarian Affairs of the United Nations / International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction ( UNDHA / IDNDR ) , United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) , United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization ( UNESCO ) and the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs , as well as by a representative of the Globalstar satellite communications company .
Funds allocated by the United Nations and ESA were used to defray the air travel and per diem expenses of 14 participants from 11 developing countries of the ECA region .
The Government of Zimbabwe , through ERSI , provided the conference facilities and the Government also provided local transportation for all participants in the Workshop .
The programme of the Workshop ( annex I ) , was developed jointly by the United Nations and ESA .
The Workshop held plenary and working group meetings .
At the latter , the participants discussed the issues related to the use of space technologies to prevent and combat the effects of natural disasters .
The working papers of these groups are given in annexes II-V .
A. Observations of the Workshop The critical factors that distinguish natural phenomena from natural disasters are loss of life and property .
Certainly , humans cannot prevent the occurrence of natural phenomena such as typhoons , hurricanes , earthquakes and volcanic eruptions .
Their disastrous effects , however , can be lessened significantly if well-conceived disaster-response plans and mitigation strategies are in place prior to their occurrence .
The Workshop noted that developing countries were particularly subject to natural disasters on a scale that overwhelmed the capacity of the societies concerned to cope with their aftermath .
In many cases , just one such destructive episode was sufficient to destroy the social and economic infrastructure , including the communications network .
A single major disaster could disrupt the distribution of food and water supplies , medical services , and both the local and international communication links of the stricken communities .
The Workshop noted that many of the national and regional emergency response agencies and services were not aware of the full spectrum of applications of space technology . Of particular concern was the lack of awareness of the Earth observing systems that could provide essential data for the prevention of disasters or for the mitigation and relief of their effects .
To a lesser degree , the same observations applied to satellite communications , particularly regarding recent developments in mobile communications .
In the case of natural disasters , such technology could restore communications with the local headquarters for rescue and relief operations as well as with the outside world .
During the last session of the Workshop , the participants defined four categories of disaster-related topics that needed to be addressed : data supply , information generation , decision-making and implementation / execution .
To develop outlines of recommendations that could be useful in disaster-related activities , the participants assigned themselves to one of the above groups according to their professional background . II . SUMMARY OF PRESENTATIONS
In recent years , the frequency and magnitude of major disasters , whether of a natural , technological or ecological origin , have made the world community aware of the immense loss of human life and economic resources that are regularly caused by such calamities .
Particularly hard hit are developing countries , for which the magnitude of disasters frequently outstrips the ability of the society to cope with them .
It was stated that this was due to the fact that 95 per cent of all disasters occurred in developing countries .
Over the past 20 years , the frequency and severity of natural disasters have increased .
Over this timespan , 3 million people have been killed and 1 billion have been affected by natural disasters .
Hardly a week goes by without a major disaster .
Since the earthquake in Kobe , Japan , in January 1995 , there have been over 20 large disasters reported in Africa , Asia and Latin America .
Civil strife , such as the recent events in Rwanda , also affects people , the economy and the infrastructure in ways similar to a very large natural disaster .
To date , relief continues to be the main form of disaster management .
Approximately 95 per cent of all resources spent on disaster-related activities are for relief and recovery operations .
Nevertheless , disasters can be reduced if adequate research and proven prevention , preparedness and emergency measures are taken .
The effects of disasters can only be reduced through the deployment of the very best systems and knowledge , and following well-prepared overall national and regional contingency plans .
A single hazardous event can destroy the social and economic infrastructure , including communications systems , that may have taken years to develop and upon whose vitality local and national economies depend .
Even in normal times , particularly in developing countries , the capacities of these infrastructures are often strained to manage even the most basic social and economic development programmes , and a single disaster can severely disrupt the community lifelines that provide food distribution , water supplies , health-care services , waste disposal and communications locally and with the rest of the world .
In order to realize their fullest potential , developing countries need a sustained period of social and economic growth .
Major impediments to sustained growth are disasters , which often result in an affected country shifting its economic policies to sustain the energy required to cope with disaster response and subsequent reconstruction .
These shifts can intensify a country &apos;s financial imbalances and deplete available resources .
In many cases such a situation can be prevented .
Frequently , the difference between saving and losing lives and property is an effective warning of an impending disaster .
Timely warning of a major natural hazard can reduce its consequences : at least , people may have enough time to save their lives ; at most , they have an opportunity to relocate or otherwise protect their property .
A. The role of the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction
and the contribution of space technology The International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction ( IDNDR ) 1990-1999 operates within the framework of the Department of Humanitarian Affairs of the United Nations and was proclaimed by the General Assembly in its resolution 44 / 236 of 22 December 1989 with the objective of reducing , by concerted international action , especially in developing countries , the loss of life , property damage and social and economic disruption caused by natural disasters such as earthquakes , windstorms , tsunamis , floods , landslides , volcanic eruptions , wildfires , infestations of grasshoppers and locusts , droughts and desertification , and other calamities of natural origin .
The IDNDR secretariat recognizes that space technologies , including remote sensing , global positioning and satellite communications systems , offer disaster managers valuable tools that can be used to prepare for , mitigate and , in some cases , prevent the effects of disasters .
Appropriate applications of space technologies can also be used to respond more effectively to needs resulting from disasters .
IDNDR provides an international mechanism to focus attention on the benefits of applying these and other technologies .
Importantly , it directs the disaster management community beyond the issue of simply using state-of-the-art space technologies in disaster relief and early warning because it promotes a recognition that the national infrastructures that make possible these applications must be encouraged and supported .
Because of the typically high infrastructure investment that is required for constructing and managing space-based programmes , national , and local , systems are out of reach for most of the countries hardest hit by natural disasters .
Therefore , the IDNDR secretariat is seeking ways of encouraging the development of cooperative approaches for sharing space-based resources .
Although the sovereignty of the country affected by the disaster should be recognized , the planning and administration of this process must also include recipient countries .
The development of an autonomous basic research capability in scientific and technical disciplines , including space-related fields , should be a main goal as advocated in ongoing activities within the United Nations , most notably through the Office for Outer Space Affairs .
Such capability would promote creative thinking to adapt , modify and create new technologies that could contribute to national development and the reduction of casualties and property damage .
B. Regional disaster-related problems and projects
There are many disaster-reduction challenges confronting Southern Africa , the major hazards of concern being drought , epidemics , cyclones and storms , floods and armed conflict .
In 1991 and 1992 , more than 20 million people in this region were defined as severely drought affected .
Drought in this region is also associated with other hazards , such as flash floods and epidemic diarrhoea , including cholera and dysentery .
In 1995 there have been flash floods in Botswana , northern Namibia and parts of Southern Africa .
Unfortunately , for Southern Africa , cholera and dysentery constitute a serious threat .
In 1993 , more than 50,000 cases of cholera and up to 73,000 cases of shizella dysentery were recorded in five Southern African countries .
In 1994 , more than 171,000 cases of dysentery were reported for Malawi , Mozambique and Zimbabwe , claiming nearly 600 lives .
Irrespective of whether the hazard is meteorological , such as a cyclone , epidemiological , such as a cholera outbreak , or hydrological , such as a drought , Southern Africa &apos;s most disaster prone communities are those already vulnerable due to poverty , isolation , and dependence on degraded land and location in crowded informal settlements .
Disaster reduction is synonymous with lowering this vulnerability , a daunting challenge facing Southern African governments during a time of fiscal restraint and economic structural adjustment .
In Zimbabwe , remote sensing and GIS projects started as small disjointed donor-funded projects that were designed to test the applicability of the technology in different fields of application .
The earliest pilot projects were in the fields of land-use planning and vegetation monitoring .
At that time , satellite data came in as computer compatible tapes in the diplomatic baggage of the technical personnel from donor countries .
In 1987 , ERSI was inaugurated as a service centre to spearhead advances in the use of remote sensing and GIS technology .
The facility was set up as a joint project between the governments of Zimbabwe and Germany .
With time , it was realized that there was a need to coordinate the projects that were being developed all over the country in order to take advantage of already existing data sets , hardware and software to rationalize human and technical resources .
The research council of Zimbabwe established a subcommittee on remote sensing in an attempt to coordinate remote sensing activities in the country .
A working group on GIS was also established .
ERSI is presently involved in capacity building , both in-house and within the existing and new-user community .
The limited success in the control of land degradation and desertification may be attributed to a number of factors that include lack of data relating to the spatial and temporal dimensions of the problem .
High-resolution satellite remote sensing data is suitable for the collection of spatial data for broad planning and monitoring .
The possibility of assessing in particular the spatial and temporal dimensions of the problem of desertification is enhanced .
In Ghana , the most extensive use of high resolution satellite data to map current land use and cover for the country is currently taking place within the Remote Sensing Applications Unit of the Department of Geography , University of Ghana .
The project is using satellite image data to map land use at the scale of 1 : 250,000 as a part of the Environmental Information Systems Development component of the Ghana Environmental Resources Management Project ( GERMP ) .
GERMP is part of the implementation of the Environmental Action Plan prepared by the Ghana Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) .
The other sets of data to be produced include topography , meteorology , soil suitability and land ownership .
These databases are expected to be available by 1997 to be organized into an environmental database that will be developed and shared in an environmental information systems network .
The Desertification Control Unit within EPA will be expected to use the maps to assess the medium-term and longer term effects of the many environmental and land-use programmes and projects currently being undertaken in all the ecological zones of the country , but particularly in the northern savannahs .
In the United Republic of Tanzania , recurring fire hazards , whether natural or human-made , have swept the vegetation off of various areas of the country except in the very wet rain forest .
Deliberate or accidental fires have had disastrous effects on the ecology and economy of the areas concerned .
In developing countries such as the United Republic of Tanzania , however , the deliberate burning of vegetation continues to aid farming and hunting of game in forested areas .
The impact of fire on forest land can be detected by using remote sensing techniques and GIS .
With respect to technology management , the latest GIS programs , IDRISI and TOSCA , have already been introduced in the United Republic of Tanzania through the United Nations Institute for Training and Research ( UNITAR ) .
It may be concluded that remote sensing images are a useful database source when used in conjunction with sufficient ground surveys in combating forest fires .
In 1992 a project was initiated in South Africa to develop a monitoring system for drought and vegetation conditions .
This operation requires information at regular intervals at a national level .
The advanced very high resolution radiometer ( AVHRR ) instrument carried by satellites of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) of the United States of America is the only commercial data source available to satisfy the needs and requirements of a fully operational exercise of this magnitude .
Unique properties , such as daily coverage of a large area , facilitate regular inventories to be made of natural events on a national scale .
Daily NOAA / AVHRR satellite images are used as a primary input source to produce monthly inventories of the whole country in the form of vegetation index maps .
Analyses and comparisons of current and historical maps enable the objective assessment of the effect of prevailing or emerging drought conditions in a timely fashion .
With proper calibration and the establishment of a continuous long-term database , this information will become a strong tool for decision makers and land managers .
C. Current and future possibilities for satellite communications
Traditional terrestrial telecommunications , particularly in remote areas of disaster-prone countries , have been costly to install , difficult to repair and vulnerable to damage .
Accordingly , such systems have been virtually useless in areas where geography or climate have inhibited their installation and maintenance , and thus have been of limited value to disaster managers .
Fixed satellite services , though useful in disaster planning and warning , have been of relatively limited effectiveness in disaster response , principally because of the need for large receiving and transmitting antennas and their associated high power requirement , and vulnerability to effects of disasters .
Mobile satellite services have been one of the most recent and dynamic communications technologies available to disaster managers .
This low-cost communication capability has proven , even in the relatively short time of its commercial availability , to offer dramatic results in relief efforts that have not been possible before .
Furthermore , as a complement to remote sensing and the global positioning system ( GPS ) , space technology and GIS information management applications , mobile satellite services have the capability to dramatically improve risk assessment , disaster preparedness , early warning , and onset and post-disaster relief operations .
These services are now available to areas previously considered inaccessible because of their location , terrain , weather or demography .
In the future , global mobile communications systems , such as the many planned low Earth orbit ( LEO ) systems , will greatly enhance the disaster mitigation efforts of relief organizations .
Providing truly global personal communications , these systems , including the proposed Globalstar system , will provide a wide array of opportunities for information exchange through voice , digital data transfer and paging .
An alternate , or back-up capability , will also be provided to ground-based emergency alerting and local services for immediate reporting and request for assistance capabilities in natural disasters , accidents and other emergencies as well as aviation and marine navigation .
A few years ago the mobile satellite technologies that had for so long been employed on an experimental basis were only then beginning to be used in institutions .
Mobile satellite services offering land , aeronautical and maritime mobile communications are now being used regularly in disaster applications and will be used increasingly throughout the 1990s and beyond .
The growing awareness and consideration of these societal issues together with advances in spaceborne technology mean that effective , affordable and global mobile satellite communications and remote sensing capabilities that should significantly reduce the devastating effects of natural disasters should soon be implemented .
Because mobile satellite communications systems are independent of the local telecommunications infrastructure , they are not affected by natural disasters and they are frequently the only means of communications to and from a stricken area .
The Inmarsat satellite system can be used in all phases of dealing with natural disasters , monitoring and prediction , warning , and early intervention and emergency operations , and can also provide communications support for rehabilitation and reconstruction after a disaster strikes .
The 1994 IDNDR World Conference on Natural Disaster Reduction , held at Yokohama , Japan , identified telecommunications and information systems as two of the main elements of its &quot; Strategy for a safer world and plan of action &quot; , which was subsequently endorsed by the General Assembly in its resolution 49 / 22 B of 20 December 1994 .
The Tampere Conference in 1991 , as well as the World Conference on Telecommunications Development of the International Telecommunication Union ( ITU ) , held at Buenos Aires in 1994 and the subsequent Kyoto Plenipotentiary Conference , endorsed the principle of maximum use of existing satellite and terrestrial telecommunications systems for disaster mitigation .
This includes the preparation of national disaster emergency and contingency plans , establishment of pools of expertise and equipment for such purposes , inclusion of emergency telecommunications systems in national development plans and revision of national regulatory policies to allow effective deployment of telecommunications in disasters and emergencies .
National contingency plans can help to minimize the impact of sudden natural disasters , for example by the pre-positioning of emergency supplies and communications equipment , including satellite communications systems , at strategic locations such as government premises and hospitals in areas known to be at risk .
As the process of identifying needs and the subsequent funding and deployment of satellite communications systems can take months , such activity has to be started as soon as possible .
For slowly developing disasters , such as droughts or famines , a different telecommunications strategy is needed .
The impact of disasters on sustainable development has been shown to be very severe .
As telecommunications are one of the essential tools for disaster management , the national emergency or disaster management planners need to consider how best to use the available networks and systems during the research and monitoring phase , as well as for contact with established international aid agencies during the relief phase .
Preparedness planning for all disasters and emergencies involves national civil defence , emergency response organizations and various government departments .
The military is increasingly called on to contribute in this role .
The International Committee of the Red Cross and other health organizations also participate .
An increasing number of preparations are being conducted on a regional basis .
While the levels of technical ability and understanding of technology of local personnel are steadily increasing , the main problem is lack of funds .
This , however , can often be overcome by international cooperation or external funding .
Monitoring weather and climate has long been an invaluable tool in predicting and combating natural disasters .
Inmarsat satellite communications systems help in the gathering and dissemination of meteorological data .
The World Meteorological Organization ( WMO ) , for example , has been using the Inmarsat-C data messaging service to send observation data from ships at sea via Inmarsat Land Earth Stations in Southbury and Goonhilly in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland .
This global network of observatories using Inmarsat systems contributes to the prediction and monitoring of cyclones , hurricanes and typhoons and other variables affecting maritime weather .
Under the auspices of its Regional Centre for Training and Applications in Agrometeorology and Operational Hydrology ( AGRHYMET ) programme , WMO has recently established a network of land-based monitoring stations in western Africa .
A regional centre is located in Niger .
Observation posts in nine countries , each of them equipped with an Inmarsat-A portable satellite communication system , report regularly on climate and soil conditions in real-time , complementing GIS and remote sensing data .
Such information enables better medium- and long-range planning of agriculture and forestry activities , and helps more effective mitigation in an area covering millions of square kilometres .
UNEP is another Inmarsat user in Africa .
Inmarsat terminals coupled with appropriate sensors provide supervisory control and data acquisition .
Such equipment can play a vital role in providing or improving the monitoring and early warning functions , even from the most remote areas .
The monitoring of geothermal and volcanic variables , tectonic-plate movement and pressure ridges helps to identify potential volcanic or earthquake activity .
The United Nations has also recognized the utility of Inmarsat portable satellite communications systems .
Its United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination ( UNDAC ) teams , dispatched to a disaster site within hours , routinely carry messaging or phone / fax satcoms when assessing disasters .
Their timely reports help to mobilize experts , supplies and equipment during the crucial 24-72 hours after disaster strikes .
The media also uses Inmarsat systems to report on disasters , especially for the transmission of compressed and slow-scan videos , still pictures and direct , high-quality audio broadcasts .
The media play a big part in highlighting a country &apos;s plight , which can help to expedite external assistance .
However , it is not only the media who need accurate and timely information .
During the acute phase of an emergency , speedy and accurate transmission of all relevant information is a major requirement for effective work by disaster relief organizations .
Lists and reports can be compiled quickly and transmitted via mobile satellite communications systems to disaster relief coordinators and other agencies using existing software programs for the management of personnel and supplies .
Immediately following a disaster , field workers in their vehicles or trucks carrying relief supplies often become immobilized due to local conditions .
Therefore , regular communications and position reporting is highly desirable .
Using Inmarsat mobile satellite communications systems and GPS , operations control is able to monitor the progress and location of all equipped vehicles , as well as send messages to them , regardless of the state of the local infrastructure , weather conditions and other impediments .
The introduction by INTELSAT of the new demand assignment multiple access ( DAMA ) service , especially for thin-route communications , will enhance connectivity in devastated areas . It will make digital satellite public switched services available to more users , especially in rural and remote areas .
DAMA is a flexible , pay-as-you-use service , offering improved connectivity at a low cost , while providing a complete digital solution for thin-route operators .
INTELSAT plans to introduce thin-route DAMA in April 1996 on a global transponder on the INTELSAT 605 at 24.5o east covering its Atlantic Ocean region .
This means that all gateway stations equipped with DAMA will be able to communicate with each other .
Implementation of DAMA service in the Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean regions is expected shortly thereafter .
DAMA will benefit all users of the system , particularly those in developing countries .
INTELSAT expects DAMA to be of great benefit in re-establishing communications after natural disasters .
By bringing in fly-away transportable antennas , it will be possible to instantaneously re-establish contact with the rest of the world on the DAMA network .
In 1959 , when Volunteers in Technical Assistance ( VITA ) was created to provide technical information and assistance to individuals and groups in developing countries , the first inquiries came from Africa .
Africa is still the principal user of the VITA Inquire Service .
VITA also supplies information on natural disasters and human-made crises such as civil strife and refugee movements .
In 1987 , VITA established its Disaster Information Center .
One of the services provided by the Center is a telephone hotline .
When called on by the Government of the United States of America for assistance in responding to a disaster , within one day VITA activates its telephone bank , selects and trains volunteers , and begins to record offers and donations of medicine and other commodities .
The VITA hotline has provided information on civil strife , floods , cyclones , food shortages , earthquakes , droughts and rains in Algeria , Angola , Benin , Burundi , Cameroon , Djibouti , Egypt , Eritrea , Ethiopia , Kenya , Liberia , Madagascar , Mauritius , Mozambique , Niger , Nigeria , Rwanda , Senegal , Somalia , Southern Africa , Sudan , United Republic of Tanzania , Uganda and Zaire .
VITA has identified that one of the major needs for development is reliable communications and that the principal global telecommunications operators have little interest in providing service in most developing countries .
Therefore , VITA has developed its own communications programmes , which includes LEO satellites ( VITASAT ) , terrestrial digital radio networks ( VITAPAC ) and electronic mail services ( VITANET ) .
The VITA electronic bulletin board , VITANET , is a multi-line , commercial grade system that allows for on-line database searching , access to training materials , computer conferences , on-line surveys and file transfer utilities , all of which are enormously useful during a disaster and for disaster preparedness activities .
VITANET software interfaces will make it possible to link the VITA satellite system and packet radio networks , so that fully-automated end-to-end communications are possible .
In September 1994 , VITA installed its own direct Internet host .
To date , the disaster ListServ has 129 subscribers who have received approximately 20,000 documents .
In addition , more than 12,000 documents were picked up through the its gopher .
The VITASAT global electronic messaging network is a satellite-based communications system for commercial , government and non-profit users worldwide .
It utilizes LEO store-and-forward satellites in polar orbit .
This system will provide large message and file transfers over 9.6 kilobits per second ( kbps ) links and offers two basic services : e-mail / fax transmission , and supervisory control and data acquisition .
Local people need to be made aware of the situation and local relief agencies , such as fire or ambulance services , need to be alerted .
If help is organized by international relief agencies , this should also be known to the local population .
There are various methods for broadcasting information to the area affected by a disaster .
It is possible , for example , to receive information directly from a satellite or for messages to be passed via cellular networks .
However , the equipment to receive such information is normally only available to relatively prosperous sections of the community and as a result the coverage would be somewhat uneven .
The most commonly available receiving equipment is the transistor radio .
It has been estimated that there are over two billion radios in use , with nearly half of those being in the developing countries .
A system that could address a large proportion of these radios seems to have the best chance of achieving a high penetration .
Broadcasting directly to these receivers must be done by terrestrial means .
This can most conveniently and economically be achieved by use of the FM / VHF bands of frequencies , for which most transistor radios are already equipped .
Distribution of the signal to the area concerned is most conveniently carried out by satellite .
Existing satellite capacity is available and can be leased for this purpose .
The receiving equipment for the satellite signal can be a relatively simple receive-only Earth station with a 2.4 m antenna and a 64 kbps link .
WMO already uses such a system and it can easily be extended for disaster applications .
The information received by the station can be disseminated directly to the local population through transistor radios or directed to the local emergency services , as appropriate .
Each receiver / transmitter combination has a coverage area of 40 kms in diameter in flat terrain .
D. Use of data from remote sensing satellites
Remote sensing has become an important source of geographic information on current land cover and land use needed for rational development and sustainable management of agricultural and forestry resources and for environmental protection .
Users have to compromise to fit their information requirements to the parameters of available remote sensing data .
Furthermore , the countries that have the most pressing need for remote sensing do not have the resources to build the necessary capacities for its efficient use .
The increasing volumes of image data that are generated or the number of image products that are sold should not be used as a measure to gauge the success of satellite remote sensing .
The ultimate criterion of its success will be the extent to which remote sensing will have contributed to the quality of life on Earth .
Greater international effort should made to apply new remote sensing and GIS capacities where they are needed most : for monitoring environmental degradation and for implementing programmes for the sustainable management of natural resources in order to safeguard them for future generations .
Particular attention should be given to the needs of developing countries and to strengthening their national remote sensing and GIS capacities .
The Regional Remote Sensing Project ( RRSP ) of FAO is a component of the Early Warning System for the Southern Africa Development Community ( SADC ) region .
Output from this project is fed into the combined physical and socio-economic data used by the Regional Early Warning Unit ( REWU ) and the Household Food Security Project .
The main objective of the present phase of the project is to strengthen national and regional capabilities in the area of remote sensing for early warning and food security by the establishment of an operational information system .
As such , RRSP is developing national capacities for the analysis and interpretation of coarse-resolution satellite imagery and for the subsequent generation of information products .
At present , satellite data processed by the project and the resulting information products are sent to the contact points and a number of users in the SADC region using mail courier services .
The current phase of the project will see specific attention being given to the transfer of the processing technology to the principal contact points in the countries .
To support this , e-mail links are being established between RRSP , REWU and meteorological services in the SADC countries .
Finally , the project will establish a low-cost integrated satellite data acquisition system for NOAA and METEOSAT data in Harare .
Geologists , engineers , industrialists and planners are now more frequently using remote sensing in the evaluation of hazard situations .
In hazard prevention studies , the interpretation of satellite data together with the analysis of geological records make it possible to reconstruct a historical overview of the occurrence of damaging events .
This information can be used statistically to make a prognosis of potential risk in the occurrence of a catastrophe or for the production of thematic maps that show the spatial context in which hazards occur .
Remote sensing is not only used in preventive studies , but also in the monitoring of dynamic geological processes such as terrain deformation , neotectonic activities and flooding .
Recently , a new technique using synthetic aperture radar ( SAR ) satellite data , called radar interferometry , has been introduced in the analysis of vertical displacement associated with fault movements .
On 17 July 1991 , ESA launched the first European Remote Sensing satellite ( ERS-1 ) , a polar orbiting satellite that constituted a major development in remote sensing applications by providing new tools for assisting in natural disasters monitoring and relief .
ERS-2 was launched on 21 April 1995 in order to ensure continuity of data acquisition .
However , since ERS-1 is still fully operational , the two satellites are operated by ESA in a tandem mode that provides a unique opportunity for several applications .
The two ERS satellites provide a wealth of radar information for many applications .
They are both equipped with several microwave sensors as well as an optical radiometer .
The main radar equipment is the Active Microwave Instrument ( AMI ) , which can be operated in an imaging mode as a side-looking SAR , thereby providing high-resolution image data in C-band ( 5.3 GHz ) at regional scales .
Because microwave radiation suffers very little attenuation in passing through clouds and rainfall ( except very heavy thunderstorms ) , the ERS-1 and ERS-2 SARs provide images of the tropical areas that heretofore could not be thoroughly mapped with LANDSAT and SPOT because of the constant presence of clouds in the region .
Furthermore , the complementarity between optical and radar images of the same area has already proven to be an excellent and powerful tool for advanced applications and an asset in natural disaster monitoring and relief .
On a global scale , the ERS-1 AMI SAR is operated as a wave scatterometer over water to generate SAR &quot; imagettes &quot; of 6 km x 5 km along the SAR swath at 200 km intervals .
Through the analysis of the imagette spectrum , operational worldwide information on the wave systems , namely wave height and wave direction , is derived .
Such products are disseminated within three hours from data sensing to nominated centres through the global meteorological network for subsequent assimilation into numerical analysis and forecast models .
The ERS-1 AMI can also be operated as a wind scatterometer to provide wind vectors at the ocean surface on a 25 km grid .
Sea surface backscattering signals of radar pulses emitted at three different side-looking angles are measured on board and then elaborated on the ground through a C-band model to generate surface vectors with the same accuracy for conventional ground measurements .
Like the ERS SAR wave data , AMI wind vectors are also disseminated operationally through the global telecommunication system .
Data from the ERS wind scatterometer are of particular help in the tropical region , in the southern hemisphere and in the northern Pacific Ocean because of the very limited amount of available statistical data on these areas .
ERS-1 radar altimeter data provide worldwide surface information .
Several measurements are derived at a global scale from backscattered signals of downward emitted radar pulses , including the height of sea and ice surfaces , the height of sea waves and the wind speed at the sea surface .
Additional geodetic and climatological information is generated from the former , which leads to the availability of some important climatic change indicators , such as anomalies in ocean topography ( e.g. el Ni√±o and la Ni√±a ) or in ice melting ( e.g. Antarctic caps ) .
The precise range and range rate equipment ( PRARE ) , operational on ERS-2 , allows precise orbit calculations to be made and accurate corrections to radar altimeter measurements to be implemented .
In addition , ERS satellites carry an along-track scanning radiometer ( ATSR ) , a dual instrument constituted by an optical and a passive microwave radiometer .
The optical radiometer on ERS-1 works in four infrared spectral bands , at 1.6 , 3.7 , 11 and 12 micrometers ; three visible channels have been added to the ERS-2 version .
Very accurate sea surface temperature measurements are provided globally on a 50 km grid , with an intrinsic original 1 km spatial and 0.1 K radiometric resolution .
A dual viewing , oblique at 50 degrees ahead and vertical , together with internal black-body calibration leads to very accurate atmospheric corrections .
The visible channels added to the ERS-2 radiometer allow the derivation of vegetation indices .
The ATSR Microwave Sounder is a dual frequency passive radiometer , whose data are used primarily to correct radar altimeter measurements and to determine the atmospheric vapour content .
High-resolution satellite imagery ( HRSI ) is an important tool for increasing the efficiency during the planning and implementation phases of refugee work relief operations .
Until recently , the highest resolution satellite images commercially available have been 10 m resolution SPOT images .
Currently , images with 2 m resolution obtained from Russian military satellites are commercially available .
This information can be used to obtain estimates of refugee-camp population , area and growth rates .
The interpretation of such high-resolution images should be strongly linked to the United Nations in order to utilize already established communication lines with relief agencies .
In the near future , sensors with ground resolution down to 1 m will be commercially available .
The data distribution systems of these satellites will be vastly improved in comparison to the present ones .
However , an unfortunate trend might be seen in the data distribution plans of some commercial companies that intend to offer exclusive rights to the customers on a first-come , first-served basis , denying access to the images for late customers .
It is therefore important for the United Nations to play an active role in forming policies to distribute HRSI .
Data from satellite-based radar systems can also be used in many ways for natural hazard reduction .
The most conventional use of radar data is the recognition of flooded areas by the dark signature of still water in a radar image associated with the all-weather capability of the instrument .
The 1 m accuracy of the models created by ERS-1 data is unmatched by other space-based techniques .
The dense spatial samplings ( 100 pixels / sq km ) provided by radar interferometry in the detection of displacements associated with its accuracy ( in the range of 3-10 mm ) make it an important tool for assessing most natural hazards .
This tool could be used as a cheap warning signal in the case of volcanoes , as was demonstrated in the case of the recent activity at Mount Etna .
The ERS-1 satellite can also provide the data required for global monitoring of all potentially hazardous volcanoes .
Radar interferometry can also contribute to the understanding of earthquakes , especially in poorly equipped areas because it does not require ground instrumentation .
Some current limitations of these techniques are linked to the physics of the atmosphere , the contribution of which can only be separated by the analysis of multiple image pairs and the change of the surface state in long periods of time that spoils the interference patterns .
A high throughput system such as ERS-1 proved capable of delivering the many images required .
Other limitations come from the features of current space-borne radar instruments , which were not designed for this purpose .
The experience gained could be of help when designing better systems in the future .
However , the built-in design margins of ERS-1 permit its operational use in the field of interferometry , for which it was not initially designed .
E. A global monitoring and warning satellite system
The Japanese Space Agency , NASDA , is emphasizing the development of data analysis technology for a variety of applications including natural disaster reduction .
For the development of technology for data application in the field of natural disaster reduction , NASDA is considering cooperative research projects , such as the Global Earth Observation System ( GEOS ) , the Advanced Earth Observing Satellite ( ADEOS ) , the Advanced Land Observing Satellite ( ALOS ) , and the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission ( TRMM ) , with the international user community for the verification of algorithms to be applied to actual case-studies .
NASDA is also planning to reflect user requirements in the field of natural disaster reduction to future programmes .
The purpose of the World Environment and Disaster Observation System ( WEDOS ) and the Global Disaster Observation System ( GDOS ) of the Society of Japanese Aerospace Companies , Inc. is to provide continuous operational monitoring of the Earth &apos;s environment in order to detect and mitigate natural disasters and human-induced accidents .
A total of 26 remote sensing satellites will be launched into low altitude , sun synchronous and circular orbits together with 12 ( 6 in-orbit spares ) data relay satellites in geostationary orbit .
The monitoring of short-term changes is indispensable to the prevention of disasters and that type of monitoring could be accomplished by using existing technologies .
Both systems therefore concentrate on observing environmental changes that occur over short periods ( e.g. oil pollution and red tides ) and the simultaneous observation of phenomena occurring globally over the surface of Earth ( e.g. wind speed and direction of sea surface ) .
Consequently , any location in the world could be observed by WEDOS at least once a day with 20 m resolution ; therefore irregularities and environmental changes can be detected immediately .
More precise observations of the damaged areas , with 2 m resolution , will also be possible several times a day .
GDOS is a modified version of WEDOS , which facilitates the location of disasters and is capable of repeatedly observing a disaster site .
The payloads of the satellite segment of both systems would be designed to monitor the land and ocean environment , the geosphere , hydrosphere and meteorological conditions , with the aid of visible , near infrared , microwave , short-wave and thermal radiometers , synthetic aperture radar , radar altimeter and scattering lidar .
The ground segment would comprise a mission management centre , satellite control centres , a master ground station and local user stations .
Observation data would be received by the master ground station via data relay satellites and would then be recorded and processed .
The processed data would be distributed to each local user station in the world .
To implement any of these two systems it is mandatory to develop an international consensus on the importance of the subject of disasters and to gain support from the general public , scientific community , governmental and United Nations entities that are in charge of the natural environment and disaster prevention .

COMMITTEE ON THE PEACEFUL USES OF OUTER SPACE
MICROSATELLITES AND SMALL SATELLITES : CURRENT PROJECTS AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES FOR INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION
Note by the Secretariat
The Working Group of the Whole to Evaluate the Implementation of the Recommendations of the Second United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space ( UNISPACE 82 ) , at its eighth session ( A / AC.105 / 571 , annex II , para . 17 ) , proposed that several studies on space applications should be undertaken by the Office for Outer Space Affairs in view of the recommendations adopted at the workshops , seminars , symposia and conferences organized by the United Nations Programme on Space Applications .
The Working Group of the Whole identified a number of possible subjects for such studies , including microsatellites and small satellites , current projects and future perspectives for international cooperation .
The report of the Working Group of the Whole was adopted by the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee at its thirty-first session ( A / AC.105 / 571 , para . 22 ) , and the recommendations contained therein were endorsed by the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space in its report on the work of its thirty-seventh session1 and by the General Assembly in its resolution 49 / 34 of 9 December 1994 .
The present study has been prepared by the Secretariat in response to the request of the Working Group of the Whole .
The study , which is available in English only , is presented in the annex to the present note .
The purpose of the study was to give an overview of the rapidly evolving field of small satellites , which should be easily accessible even to countries with limited or newly conceived space programmes .
The study was prepared using a variety of national and international sources that are listed in the selected bibliography at the end of the study .
It was also sent in draft form to external experts for comments .
A summary of the study is provided below .
SUMMARY OF THE STUDY Small satellites have already been used with considerable success by many organizations .
Their attraction lies in the promise of low-cost and short development time , which is made possible by the use of proven standard equipment and techniques , together with a realistic expectation of performance .
The space age began with the launching of small scientific satellites in 1958 , the International Geophysical Year . Those satellites were small because of the limited capacity of the first space launchers .
After a modest beginning with small , simple and lightweight satellites , space systems evolved into large , complex and expensive space platforms for scientific research and other applications that often require many years of development prior to launch .
While such large platforms exist and will continue to exist , there has recently been a growing interest in returning to the use of small satellites , which can be launched within a few years after programme initiation .
As a consequence of the evolution of space-related technologies , this class of spacecraft can make significant space capabilities accessible to a wide number of users , ranging from students in secondary schools and universities to engineers and scientists in every country in the world .
In many ways , projects involving small satellites are ideal for extensive international cooperation .
The development of small satellites will not replace that of large satellites , as the goals and issues involved are often different .
Missions involving small satellites can , however , be a complement to large satellite missions .
By exploring new methods and techniques , small satellites can be a tool for pioneering experiments and technologies for future missions involving larger satellites .
Small satellites have several advantages over large satellites and these hold true no matter who the users are : more frequent , and a larger variety of , mission opportunities ; more rapid expansion of the technical knowledge base ; greater involvement of local industry ; and greater diversification of potential users .
Moreover , even a country with a modest research budget and little or no experience with space technology can afford to participate in missions involving small satellites .
Small satellites also offer excellent opportunities for training students , engineers and scientists in different disciplines , including engineering , software development for computers on board and on the ground and management of sophisticated technical programmes .
Recent technological progress in many areas means that small satellites can offer services previously only available from much larger satellites .
Fairly sophisticated scientific and technological experiments , as well as application missions , can be flown in space at modest costs .
The areas of application include : space physics , astronomy , astrophysics , technology demonstrations , communications experiments and acquisition of Earth resource data , including disaster information .
The definition of a small satellite varies , but an upper limit of about 400 kg ( in exceptional cases 500 kg ) is usually adopted , within which there are two main categories : small satellites ( or minisatellites ) , which weigh about 100-400 kg ; and microsatellites , which weigh less than 100 kg .
A typical &quot; small satellite mission &quot; , including launch , generally costs less than US $ 20 million and most microsatellite projects cost approximately US $ 3 million .
A central issue in any small satellite mission is the optimum balance between programme complexity and risk .
Small satellites are likely to offer new opportunities for procurement methods .
The selected model philosophies are important in terms of both risk and cost and , as a maximum , a protoflight approach is acceptable for such programmes .
The advantages of small satellites are as follows :
( a ) Orbital parameters optimized to individual instrument requirements ;
( b ) Augmentation of conventional satellite programmes , such as additional capability , redundancy for critical missions , or replacement of a failed instrument ;
( c ) Missions with limited lifetime and / or coverage requirements ;
( d ) Improved responsiveness to the end-user ( more frequent launch opportunities and increased mission flexibility for individual instruments , plus schedule independence ) ;
( e ) Quick-reaction , launch-on-demand launches using low-cost dedicated vehicles ( e.g. crisis monitoring , replacement after an in-orbit failure , or monitoring of unexpected environmental conditions ) ;
( f ) Relaxed reliability owing to the shorter lifetime or agreed , lower levels of product assurance or lower-quality parts as appropriate to lower development costs ;
( g ) Reduced satellite design complexity ( e.g. simplified interfaces , optimized for instrument requirements ) , shorter development schedule and suitable test-bed for proving technique and / or technology .
There are three general classes of orbit that may be suitable for small satellites : the geostationary orbit ( GSO ) , the highly elliptical orbit ( HEO ) and the low Earth orbit ( LEO ) .
GSO is where the satellite appears fixed relative to the ground , thus allowing continuous visibility and simplifying the ground segment and operational requirements .
Because of the large space-to-ground distance involved , however , the data rates are small , or larger ground antennas and higher electrical power on board the spacecraft are required .
This orbit is usually reached from a standard geostationary transfer orbit ( GTO ) provided by a large launch vehicle .
The use of GTO is interesting as it could benefit from frequent piggyback launch opportunities while avoiding the complexity and extra costs associated with an apogee propulsion system .
LEO is generally preferred for small satellite missions .
Small launch vehicles may be used , offering flexibility in the selection of the orbit parameters ; piggyback launches may also be used .
A low-energy transmitter on board is sufficient because of the short distance from the ground , but infrequent and short visibility periods are a drawback , leading to some ground-segment and operational complexity .
A distinction should be made between the near equatorial or low inclination orbits , for which the visibility zone will be limited to the topical zone , and the polar and quasi-polar ( Sun-synchronous ) orbits that allow accessibility to any point on Earth , either for communication ( e.g. store and forward ) or for remote sensing of Earth .
The current and future development of small satellites is closely linked to the appearance of new , low-cost launchers ( Pegasus , Taurus etc . ) and lower-cost launch opportunities on existing vehicles ( for example , Ariane-4 or small canisters on the Space Shuttle ) .
The potential availability of cheap launchers has spurred much of the recent surge of interest in small satellites , which was initially driven largely by defence and global civil communication programmes of the United States of America .
Of the major low-cost launchers of European countries and the United States , only Pegasus and Taurus are flight-proven .
Conestoga is planned for flight in the near future , development of the Italian San Marco Scout has not yet started ( although its forerunner , the United States Scout , has been operated for many years ) and the Ariane-5 derivative programme should be completed in 1999 .
In order to maximize their potential , small launcher developers must apply the same innovative , low-cost design approach used on small satellites .
Launch costs represent a large portion of total programme costs ( generally over 25 per cent ) and satellite mass and size must therefore be constrained to take full advantage of low-cost launch opportunities .
Options include :
( a ) Small dedicated launchers ;
( b ) Multiple launch of several small satellites , nominally on Ariane-4 or Ariane-5 for European missions ( e.g. Cluster scientific satellites of the European Space Agency ( ESA ) ) ;
( c ) Flight opportunities on larger launchers ( Arianespace has strongly promoted its vehicles for this purpose , with Ariane-4 offering : Ariane Structure for Auxiliary Payloads ( ASAP ) for piggyback microsatellites ( up to six 50 kg satellites ( 300 kg total ) ) ; Ariane Radioamateur Satellite Enseignement Espace ( ARSENE ) -type configuration for satellites of up to 200 kg ; and SPELDA Dedicated Satellite ( SDS ) for satellites in the range of 400-800 kg within the short Ariane Dual Launch External Bearing Structure ( SPELDA ) adapter .
Similar options are provided by other medium-sized or large launchers , for example , the United States Atlas Centaur and the Delta-2 .
Requirements for the ground segment of a small satellite system vary enormously depending on the application area .
At one extreme , low data rate sensors with only local or regional coverage on missions with low tracking and command requirements impose relatively low demands on the ground segment , possibly comprising only 10 per cent or less of total programme costs .
More complex data retrieval and processing requirements could result in ground segment costs of up to 50 per cent of total programme costs .
Assuming that ground segment costs tend to average 25 per cent of total programme costs , it is clearly important to identify potential savings in the ground segment in concert with those of the space segment .
In attempting to reduce the ground segment costs , there are limits on simplification because it is still necessary to ensure the achievement of capabilities such as reliable operation , rapid response to critical commands and regular form of data on time and with low loss . The ground segment model , which forms the basis of any technical and cost assessments , must include not just the provision of the ground stations , but also ground communications infrastructure , mission control etc .
Very small , in some cases transportable , stations have been made commercially available by several suppliers in European countries and in the United States .
Commercial providers of remote sensing data are likely to press for the adoption of such approaches in attempts to reduce the cost of distributing and processing the data .
Space science activities are obviously valuable , and most space-faring nations have begun their involvement in this field with small scientific satellites .
The first small scientific satellite of Argentina will be the Scientific Applications Satellite ( SAC-B ) , which is being developed jointly by its national space agency , the National Commission for Space Activities ( CONAE ) , and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) of the United States .
The 190 kg satellite is to be launched in 1996 by a Pegasus rocket into a circular orbit of 550 km with an inclination of 37 degrees .
SAC-B will be inertially stabilized and permanently oriented to the Sun .
It will monitor energetic X-rays from solar flares and survey the sky with X-ray charge-coupled device ( CCD ) sensors along an axis perpendicular to the Sun line .
Between 1978 and 1991 , scientific microsatellites weighing 15-50 kg were developed for the Magnetosphere-Ionosphere ( MAGION ) research programme in the former Czechoslovakia .
MAGION-1 was launched on 24 October 1978 as a subsatellite of the INTERCOSMOS-18 geophysical satellite .
Although it was designed for an operational lifetime of three weeks , MAGION-1 remained operational for three years .
MAGION-2 and MAGION-3 were launched into high-inclination low-eccentricity orbits ( with an altitude of 500-3,200 km ) as part of the ACTIVE and Ariane Passengers Experiment ( APEX ) mother-daughter active space missions launched on 28 September 1989 and on 18 December 1991 , respectively .
The MAGION-4 subsatellite was successfully launched by a Molniya launcher from the cosmodrome at Plesetsk , Russian Federation , on 3 August 1995 , as part of the INTERBALL-tail mission .
MAGION-5 is currently scheduled for a 1996 launch .
The Central European Satellite for Advanced Research ( CESAR ) is a spacecraft of about 300 kg that will fly in an orbit with a perigee of 400 km , an apogee of 1,000 km and an inclination of 70 degrees .
The scientific mission is related to the study of the magnetosphere , ionosphere and thermosphere of Earth .
This mission is one of the objectives of the cooperation among the countries of the Central European Initiative .
Space industry and research institutions in Finland have acquired experience in satellite payloads and instrumentation through their associate membership in ESA and have long been active in remote sensing and other space-related disciplines .
To initiate a study of a Finnish small satellite ( FS-1 ) , Finnish institutes defined their interests by contacting selected institutes with an unofficial announcement of opportunity and by asking for proposals .
After the proposal phase , system design was performed for two alternatives : a scientific satellite and an Earth observation satellite .
Each satellite would contain a technology demonstration package in which new electronic components would be tested in the space environment .
The French National Centre for Space Studies ( CNES ) is currently considering the following small scientific satellites :
( a ) Mission SAMBA : registration of the local fluctuations of 3 kelvin radiation from the big bang ( similar to the Cosmic Background Explorer ( COBE ) satellite of the United States ) and detailed measurement of possible anisotropies ;
( b ) Mission COROT : astroseismology , new data on the convection and internal rotation of stars by long-term measurement of stellar oscillations ;
( c ) Mission IBIZA : registration of the plasma accelerated in the geomagnetic auroral regions , interaction of ionized particles with the ionosphere and magnetosphere of Earth , creation of electromagnetic disturbances ;
( d ) QUICK-STEP : verification of the equivalence of the inertial and gravitational mass ( theory of relativity ) with a relative precision of 10-17 .
On 3 February 1994 , the small satellite of the University of Bremen , BREMSAT , was carried into orbit by the United States Space Shuttle Discovery .
The spacecraft , which weighed 63 kg , waited six days in its Get Away Special ( GAS ) container before it was deployed into its initial circular orbit of 350 km .
The satellite carried six experiments with different scientific objectives , including heat conductivity under microgravity , micrometeorite and dust particle distribution , atmospheric atomic oxygen mapping and re-entry pressures and temperatures .
The satellite functioned until its in-orbit decay on 12 February 1995 .
In developing its indigenous launching capacity , India prepared a series of small technology development and scientific satellites called Rohini and the Stretched Rohini Scientific Satellite ( SROSS ) series .
The Rohini satellites were launched between 1980 and 1983 and carried a landmark sensor payload including a solid state camera .
More than 2,500 frames in both visible and infrared bands for identification of landmarks and altitude and orbit refinement were obtained . The orbital mass of the Rohini satellites was about 42 kg .
SROSS-C and SROSS-C2 were launched on 20 May 1992 and 4 May 1994 , respectively .
They each carry two scientific payloads .
The first is the retarding potential analyser , consisting of two planar detectors to measure plasma parameters and to investigate the energetic structure of the equatorial ionosphere .
The second is the gamma-ray burst experiment , consisting of two scintillation detectors to study celestial gamma-ray bursts in the energy range of 20-3,000 kilo-electronvolts .
The Instituto Nacional de Tecnica Aeroespacial ( INTA ) of Spain , situated at Torrej√≥n de Ardoz , has been entrusted by the Government with the direction of a research project for the development of a Spanish space system , called MINISAT .
The system will consist of a multi-purpose platform ( service module ) , payload module and an associated ground segment .
Both the platform and the subsystems comprising it are modular in character .
The platform will be capable of receiving , integrating , operating and carrying on board a payload module by means of standard interfaces .
This will permit all the required adaptations for a particular mission to be easily conducted .
The platform will be able to carry payloads with masses that vary between 80 and 500 kg .
The first of these satellites will be a MINISAT mission carrying a payload module ( PLM-1 ) .
The first Swedish-built satellite was the 283 kg Viking , which was launched into low polar orbit in 1986 in a piggyback configuration with the French remote sensing satellite , satellite pour l &apos;observation de la Terre ( SPOT ) .
The scientific objective of the Viking satellite was to study ionospheric and magnetospheric phenomena at high geomagnetic latitudes in the altitude region of up to about two Earth radii .
A more advanced small scientific satellite , called Freja , was launched on 6 October 1992 by a Chinese launcher .
This satellite of 214 kg is designed for auroral research and other related magnetospheric phenomena .
Because Swedish magnetospheric scientists are very interested in the possibilities of small satellites , a compact satellite platform has been developed that is 10 per cent of the mass of the Freja .
This new microsatellite , called Astrid , is shaped like a box with sides measuring approximately 50 x 50 cm and has a mass of 25 kg in its stowed configuration .
It is spin-stabilized with a Sun-pointing capability and deployable solar panels .
The first Astrid was launched on 24 January 1995 from the cosmodrome at Plesetsk on a Cosmos launcher .
The best example of the small satellite programmes in the United States is the NASA Small Explorer ( SMEX ) programme , which provides for frequent flight opportunities for highly focused and relatively inexpensive science missions .
Each SMEX spacecraft weighs approximately 250 kg and each mission is expected to cost approximately US $ 50 million for design , development and 30 days of in-orbit operations .
The first satellite of this series , the Solar , Anomalous and Magnetospheric Particle Explorer ( SAMPEX ) , was launched on 3 July 1992 .
It has been successfully investigating the composition of local interstellar matter and solar material and the transport of magnetospheric charged particles into the atmosphere of Earth .
The Submillimeter-Wave Astronomy Satellite ( SWAS ) is to be launched on a Pegasus rocket in 1995 or 1996 .
Probably the most experienced research unit in the field of microsatellites is the Spacecraft Engineering Research Unit at the University of Surrey in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland .
Since 1981 , UOSAT and , more recently , the Surrey Satellite Technology Limited ( SSTL ) team have logged over 25 orbit-years of microsatellite operations .
A total of 10 University of Surrey Satellite Project ( UOSAT ) satellites were launched between 1981 and 1993 .
The operational microsatellite S-80 / T , which is based upon the UOSAT platform , was launched in August 1992 with a mission objective to explore communication possibilities of the very high frequency World Administrative Radio Conference ( WARC-92 ) bands allocated to non-geostationary satellite systems .
The initial mission objective has been successfully achieved .
S-80 / T completed its first operational year in October 1993 while continuing its flawless functioning .
Amateur satellites of the UOSAT series are capable of transmitting images of the surface of Earth , as well as meteorological data .
The latest additions to the UOSAT family are a Portuguese satellite ( POSAT-1 ) , HEALTHSAT-2 and KITSAT-2 , which were launched together in September 1993 aboard Ariane V-59 , together with the SPOT-3 commercial remote sensing satellite .
POSAT is the result of close cooperation between SSTL Satellite and a Portuguese industrial consortium .
KITSAT-2 was built in the Republic of Korea by engineers trained by SSTL .
Its platform retains many similarities with S-80 / T and KITSAT-1 ( launched in August 1992 ) , while some payloads have been developed by engineers of the Republic of Korea .
On 9 February 1993 , a Pegasus launcher launched the first Brazilian data collection satellite ( SCD-1 ) with an inclination of 25 degrees and an altitude of 750 km .
SCD-1 , designed and built by the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research ( INPE ) is a small spin-stabilized satellite dedicated to the collection and distribution of environmental data acquired and emitted by data-collecting platforms over Brazilian territory .
Since its launching , SCD-1 has been performing excellently .
The first satellite of an Italian data collection satellite series called the Telespazio Micro Satellite ( TEMISAT ) was launched by a Russian Tsiklon launcher from the cosmodrome at Plesetsk on 31 August 1993 , together with a Meteor-2 satellite .
The satellite is orbiting the Earth at an altitude of 950 km and with an inclination of 82.5 degrees and an orbital eccentricity of less than 0.0001 .
A second unit ( TEMISAT-2 ) was manufactured together with the first one ; it is stored on the ground and could be launched to increase the in-orbit service capacity .
Applied to Earth observation missions , small satellites can be utilized independently to fulfil the function of specific payload instruments .
Several can be flown in a constellation to replace or augment the functions of a larger multi-instrumented satellite .
Small satellites will not entirely replace such large platforms , which offer both financial and scientific benefits , such as economies of scale and synergy of measurements .
In addition , large satellites are essential where specific instruments must be large enough to achieve their mission objectives with high power and very high data rates ( e.g. depending on the size of radar antenna or optical performance on aperture and focal length ) .
Potentially suitable Earth observation missions for small satellites include : global ocean sampling ( by a constellation of satellites ) ; geophysical sampling ( by a single satellite in polar orbit ) ; ocean and coastal zone colour monitoring ; single instrument payload in support of larger missions , commercial mapping and land surveys ; crisis and / or disaster monitoring ( e.g. floods , forest fires , oil spills ) , launched on demand or into a constellation ; and vegetation monitoring for agriculture and forestry .
The recurrent orbit Earth observation satellite project of Japan provides an example of a small satellite that is being used for remote sensing purposes .
By using a recurrent orbit ( with a repeating ground track every fifteenth revolution ) , the observation frequency of the area is greatly improved .
This is the origin of the Domestic Urban Area Observation Satellite ( DUOS ) concept .
The DUOS system is based on the Optical Intersatellite Communications Engineering Test Satellite , which is currently scheduled to be launched by the J-1 in 1998 .
It will have a three-axis stabilized bus with two panels of solar arrays and batteries .
Within the given mass limit , the satellite could carry the Visible and Near Infrared Radiometer and a thermal infrared radiometer .
The long-term goal of the Technical University of Berlin Satellite ( TUBSAT ) programme is the development of a three-axis stabilized observation platform that can be autonomously oriented to any desired direction with arc minute accuracy .
Of primary interest is the remote sensing of Earth , so that precise stabilization is required both for observation and for a high data transmission rate to permit real-time or almost real-time reception of the pictures .
These goals are being approached in several steps .
Based on the orbital experience of TUBSAT-A and TUBSAT-B , launched in 1991 and 1994 , respectively , instrumentation of the third spacecraft will also include three fibre optic laser gyroscopes .
A preliminary structure of TUBSAT-C has already been manufactured and is being used for three-axis air bearing experiments .
The pre-operational Fire Reconnaissance System ( FIRES ) , recently studied in Germany , will demonstrate the feasibility and usefulness of a future operational small satellite system for fire reconnaissance .
It is anticipated to be of use not only for pure detection of a fire event in large areas , but also for its ability to locate the fire , assess the extent ( in space and time ) and type of the fire and provide this information to local authorities in a timely manner .
In addition to this primary task , the system should be able to solve secondary problems such as assessment of vegetation damage , assessment of atmospheric pollution and evaluation of the revitalization of burned areas .
Furthermore , when the satellite is not over vegetated areas , its sensor system can contribute to other remote sensing tasks related to high temperature detection .
A satellite health network has been proposed for western Africa by a non-profit agency in the United States , Volunteers in Technology Assistance , using a constellation of small LEO communication satellites to link regional medical centres with village clinics and mobile health teams .
Where it would be more economical to do so , two-way radio-telephones would be used to link villages or mobile units to local clinics , which in turn would be linked to a regional centre via satellite .
It has been estimated that 10 microsatellites could be built and launched for about US $ 21 million , while about US $ 30 million would be required for the medical facilities and the Earth station network .
Such a system could dramatically improve the access of rural people to good medical care .
If successful , the experiment would serve as a model for other remote regions .
The recent availability of relatively low-cost launch opportunities has made it conceivable for educational institutions to develop , manufacture , test and operate a small satellite .
There is always an emphasis on the active participation of members of the university community ( professors , students , postgraduates ) , which gives them invaluable practical experience with space technology and scientific research .
For example , the first Spanish microsatellite , UPM / SAT 1 , with a mass of 47 kg , has been designed and manufactured by the Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid .
It is a low-cost platform with a moderately long operational life capable of future evolution .
It was launched on 7 July 1995 as an auxiliary payload of the Ariane-40 rocket carrying the French Helios-1A satellite .
The main experiment on the satellite comprises monitoring of the behaviour of a fluid configuration called liquid bridge in microgravity conditions .
Developing a moderately complex design in a university environment should allow professors and students to get the experience necessary for more complex projects .
The Sunset satellite being developed by graduate students in electronic engineering at Stellenbosch University in South Africa is planned for launch early in 1996 .
It is a microsatellite weighing 50 kg that is compatible with an Ariane launcher and is capable of three-colour stereo imaging of Earth .
Pictures can be transmitted in real time or stored on the satellite .
The attitude of the satellite can be controlled within 1 milliradian .
The communications package includes an S-band downlink and amateur radio store and forward communications with an audio repeater to stimulate radio interest among schoolchildren .
The opportunities for small and medium-sized countries to enter into space activities at a relevant level have , in the past , been limited .
In the past decade , however , technological advances in materials and microelectronics , together with the experience gained , have allowed many significant space missions to be performed with small satellites .
In recognition of the importance of this trend for international cooperation in outer space , the International Academy of Astronautics , at its meeting in August 1992 , elevated the status of its subcommittee on small satellite programmes to the status of a full committee .
At the same time , a new subcommittee on small satellites for developing nations was created under the auspices of the committee .
It will act as a liaison with the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space , the International Space University and the International Astronautical Federation , particularly with its Committee for Liaison with International Organizations and Developing Nations .
The long-term goals of the new subcommittee are to promote the use of small satellites for the benefit of developing countries .
An assessment of these benefits is made on a regional basis , starting with the situation in Latin America .
Each assessment is to be prepared during a workshop organized by the subcommittee with representatives of interested countries .
The resulting reports will be published and will serve as a basis for further action .
The first regional workshop was held at S√£o Jos√© dos Campos , Brazil , on 20 to 23 June 1994 at the invitation of INPE .
The eventual success of small satellites and microsatellites is not considered to be in doubt ; however , before the full potential of these emerging technologies can be realized , it will be necessary to radically rethink the way missions are specified , realized , funded and operated .
The changing role of international cooperation to this effect should be further explored .
Because of the diverse nature of both applications and instruments , their needs are unlikely to be met with a common small satellite bus design , but more intensive exchange of experience with different designs could eventually lead to some kind of standardization .
The ability to adapt existing hardware readily and cheaply will also be a valuable economic asset for both manufacturer and user .
Among the main difficulties in promoting the use of small satellite technology for developing countries is the fact that the countries with established space programmes frequently do not understand the scope of problems within developing countries and that there is a lack of adequately trained local personnel .
In this context , it would be extremely valuable if the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space would pay more attention to this issue .
It is therefore pertinent that the theme fixed for special attention by the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee at its thirty-third session is &quot; Utilization of microsatellites and small satellites for the expansion of low-cost activities , taking into account the special needs of developing countries &quot; .
Based on the results of its deliberations on this special theme , as well as on recommendations contained in the present report , the Committee might propose some ways and means of ensuring substantial progress in international cooperation in this rapidly developing field .
For example , it might recommend that one or more of the educational activities of the United Nations Programme on Space Applications should be devoted to the theme of microsatellites and small satellites .

A. Background and objectives The General Assembly , in its resolution 37 / 90 of 10 December 1982 , endorsed the recommendations of the Second United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space ( UNISPACE 82 ) that the United Nations Programme on Space Applications should promote the growth of indigenous nuclei and an autonomous technological base in space technology for developing countries .
At its thirty-eighth session , in June 1994 , the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space endorsed the United Nations Programme on Space Applications for 1995 , as recommended by the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee at its thirty-first session .
Subsequently , the General Assembly , in resolution 49 / 34 of 9 December 1994 , endorsed the activities of the Programme on Space Applications for 1995 .
The present report contains a summary of the proceedings of the United Nations / International Astronautical Federation Workshop on Space Technology for Health Care and Environmental Monitoring in the Developing World .
Previous symposia and workshops in the series have been held in Austria , Canada , Israel and the United States of America .
The main objective of the Workshop was to provide participants with information on the possibilities offered by current space technologies and to discuss ways in which they could be used in ongoing or planned programmes and projects of the participants .
During the course of the Workshop successful models of space applications were presented .
Through panel discussions , the Workshop developed general principles on how developing countries could use space technologies , including remote sensing and space communications systems for health care , environmental monitoring and economic and social development .
The present report covering the background , objectives and organization of the Workshop , as well as the observations and recommendations made by the participants , has been prepared for the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and its Scientific and Technical Subcommittee .
Participants will report to the appropriate authorities in their own countries . B. Participants
The United Nations invited developing countries to participate in the Workshop .
Participants were required to have university degrees in engineering , physics , biological or medical sciences or other fields related to the themes of the Workshop .
The participants were working in programmes , projects or enterprises in which space technology could be utilized .
A few policy makers , at a decision-making level , from both national and international entities were also invited .
Funds allocated by the United Nations , IAF and the other co-sponsors for the Workshop were used to cover international air travel and per diem expenses for the period of the Workshop and the IAF Congress for selected participants from developing countries .
The following Member States and international organizations were represented at the Workshop : Bangladesh , Brazil , Cambodia , China , Costa Rica , Cuba , Egypt , Ethiopia , Ghana , India , Indonesia , Iran ( Islamic Republic of ) , Jordan , Mauritania , Mauritius , Nicaragua , Nigeria , Peru , Philippines , Senegal , Sierra Leone , Sri Lanka , Syrian Arab Republic , Thailand , Togo , Uganda and Viet Nam ; Office for Outer Space Affairs of the United Nations and World Health Organization ( WHO ) ; and Commission of the European Communities , European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites ( EUMETSAT ) , European Space Agency , European Telecommunications Satellite Organization ( EUTELSAT ) , International Astronautical Federation , International Mobile Satellite Organization ( Inmarsat ) , International Space University ( ISU ) and International Telecommunications Satellite Organization ( INTELSAT ) .
Speakers , chairmen and participants from Austria , Canada , France , Germany , Italy , Malta , Netherlands , Norway , United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America also took part in the Workshop . I. PRESENTATIONS AND DISCUSSIONS DURING THE WORKSHOP
A. General themes The Workshop featured a series of presentations on relevant space application fields by experts from both developed and developing countries .
A representative from each of the developing countries presented outlines of its national programme .
Three panel discussions preceded open discussion sessions where the participants interacted , providing information , comments , questions , recommendations and suggestions .
It was stressed repeatedly during the meeting that the problem with adopting space technology in developing countries was not with the technology itself , which existed and was readily available .
The problems were regulatory , legal , political , institutional , financial and educational .
It was suggested that a future UN / IAF workshop might focus on that matter and make recommendations to reduce those problems .
The value of space technology to developing countries was clearly recognized by the participants , as was the necessity for stronger regional cooperation and collaboration .
It was also recognized that there was a strong need for more extensive education in the benefits of space technology at all levels , from school children to political leaders .
In particular , school children should be taught subjects related to space science and technology which were most likely to be relevant to the country in future .
Space technology had become an increasingly vital part of everyday life , characterized by growing costs and complexity , which meant that most developing countries must be extremely selective about the scope and pace of their own space activities .
It had been realized that space technology could be a valuable tool for enhancing international security .
For example , a proposal for the use of a constellation of geosynchronous equatorial and polar orbiting satellites , the Global Satellite Network for Education , Tele-health and Disaster Management ( GLOSNETAD ) , was outlined .
GLOSNETAD would be connected by a network of ground stations as a global arrangement for education , health care and disaster management ,
The ever-increasing cost of space technologies and participation in space activities made international cooperation absolutely necessary for many countries wishing to benefit from the technology .
The need for international cooperation was therefore repeatedly stressed .
Space technology provided entirely new dimensions to the way in which health care and education could be delivered .
Conventional approaches required a face-to-face relation between the patient and the health-care provider .
That generally meant that patients in remote areas had very limited access to high-quality , specialized medical care .
The telephone and two-way radio had improved the situation by permitting audio communication between health-care persons in a remote area and specialists at a major centre .
However , the equitable availability of high-quality medical care depended upon interactive audio-visual communication that could be provided by space communications technology .
Telehealth was the practice of health care using interactive audio , visual and data communication .
It included health-care delivery , diagnosis , consultation , treatment , communication of data and education of both the doctor and the patient .
Recent advances in technology , especially in video storage , processing , retrieval and transmission had helped to bring telehealth within the reach of a much broader community .
Telehealth was based on the fundamental premise that there should be equitable access to quality health care .
The cost of health care was rising everywhere .
As a function of a country &apos;s gross national product ( GNP ) , the cost had shown a steady rise over the years .
Expectations of health care also continued to rise .
However , available resources were declining .
Telehealth could slow the rate of cost increases .
Moreover , it could help to achieve the goal of equitable access .
In about 50 projects that had been followed by WHO , it was found that there were significant savings in travel costs of physicians and patients .
Telehealth had been successfully used for pathology , radiology , magnetic resonance imaging , cardiology and further medical consultations .
In China , the direct and active participation of medical universities in the use and promotion of space technology had been critical in public health education and medical instruction in remote areas .
Interactive satellite transmission technology was one of the best and most reliable means of conveying health knowledge to medical workers in rural areas .
Since 1993 , the West China University of Medical Sciences had actively participated in developing radio and television programmes providing rural areas with basic information not only on health-care services , but also on epidemic diseases , thereby allowing timely mitigation strategies .
Financial and technological support from developed countries was one of the most important factors in successfully promoting the sharing of benefits of space technology to humankind .
Developing countries should place a higher priority on the active participation in and application of space technology in the fields of health care and education .
They should also improve their health care and educational organizations and infrastructures .
The HealthNet programme was developed in 1989 to cooperatively share information and communications services to support public health and medical research in the developing world .
HealthNet was currently in operation in 15 African and 5 Asian countries .
The original intent was to use low Earth orbit ( LEO ) satellites to reach rural and remote areas .
Five ground stations with a computer , radio and antenna had been established .
The satellites were low cost and could be used for electronic mail , with delivery anywhere in the world within 12 hours .
In an effort to address the problem of the globally unbalanced provision of medical and educational services , participants in the ISU 1994 summer session programme at Barcelona developed a proposal to establish the Global Access to Tele-health and Education System ( GATES ) .
By using advanced communications and information technologies for telehealth and tele-education applications , GATES would improve basic medical care and education on a global scale .
The goal of the GATES project was to reduce inequalities in health and education within countries and between countries by using telecommunications technology .
The unique aspects of the GATES system were that it took a global approach and it had the dual objective of combining health care and education .
The dual approach was justified by the fact that the highest medical and educational needs generally appeared in the same areas .
Furthermore , the basic communications requirements for health care and educational services were very similar .
Students working on that project were especially concerned with minimizing costs and keeping the infrastructure as simple as possible .
They recognized that the largest problems were economic and political .
An efficient management structure was proposed .
Membership would be open to any country , but services would be available to anyone , regardless of membership .
GATES would not only be used for health and education services , but also for environmental and disaster management applications .
The United Nations and other international organizations could influence policies that would result in the development of telehealth , distance education systems and further networks where they were needed .
Current and future satellite systems could do much to rectify the gross knowledge imbalance that existed in many parts of the world .
Regulatory , legal and political issues must be addressed and resolved if support services for health care and education were to be met .
Those issues should not be permitted to inhibit the development of essential worldwide satellite services that were feasible .
Presentations on remote sensing focused on the opportunities for using satellite data for environmental monitoring .
It was stated that developing countries would be able to utilize new developments in remote sensing systems to gain access to significantly greater quantities of valuable data .
Presentations highlighted applications in areas such as forestry , geology and mineral resources , cartography and other fields .
It was emphasized that compared with conventional ground surveys , satellite observations provided less detail but much greater economy , particularly when continuous and repetitive monitoring was required .
Although the European Remote Sensing ( ERS ) satellite system of ESA was not specifically planned to meet the needs of developing countries , its data played a vital role , in particular in the fields of environmental monitoring , food production and climate change .
In that context it was emphasized that national aid agencies should substantially increase the use of satellite data in projects funded by them .
They required , however , greater awareness of the potential of space technology for sustainable development .
Aid for food production and preservation of the environment was important not only for humanitarian reasons , but also because it benefits all the donors by cost savings and improved effectiveness in managing emergencies ; it also contributed to world political stability .
Space agencies benefited from involvement in aid projects in fields such as education by generating increased public and political interest and by demonstrating their usefulness in converting general policy statements into technical implementation .
The Workshop identified several areas where cooperation could be improved , such as an assessment of user requirements of the developing countries , accessibility of satellite data and information services at reasonable cost , promotion of well-designed pilot projects to assure transition to ongoing operational status , increased on-site education and training , provision of infrastructures for satellite data acquisition and better use of existing user interfaces .
It was agreed that the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites ( CEOS ) would be the appropriate forum in which to discuss those issues .
MERCURE , a satellite-based communications capability donated to the United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) by member States of ESA , was discussed during the Workshop .
Six European countries had provided the space segment and 16 antennas with related hardware and software .
It would provide UNEP with two different networks : subnet A , the backbone , using 7.3 m antennas providing 384 kilobytes per second ( kb / s ) ; and subnet B , for remote areas using 2.4 m antennas providing 64 kb / s .
UNEP currently transmitted about 6 million pages of data to approximately 3,000 users .
Telecommunications costs had quadrupled over the past few years to the current level of US $ 4 million annually .
The service based on MERCURE would be much more effective , and the cost to UNEP would be only US $ 6 million over a period of four years .
The backbone system would be based on 64 channels , each of which would have a capacity of 384 kb / s .
Two INTELSAT satellites - one over the Atlantic Ocean and the other over the Indian Ocean - would be used .
The MERCURE system would also provide much wider access to the Internet in Africa , and facilitate much more efficient dissemination of documents , environmental data , images and messages , resulting in substantial savings in telecommunications costs .
The Tropical Ecosystem Environment Observation by Satellite ( TREES ) project was sponsored by the Joint Research Centre of the Commission of the European Communities and ESA .
Its main objectives were the development of techniques for a global tropical forest inventory using data from the advanced very high resolution radiometer ( AVHRR ) of the United States of America as well as from the ERS-1 satellite ; the development of techniques for the detection and monitoring of active deforestation areas and measuring deforestation rates in critical areas ; and the development of a comprehensive Tropical Forest Information System to support the modelling of tropical deforestation dynamics .
The baseline assessment of tropical forest cover using AVHRR had been completed .
Synthetic aperture radar ( SAR ) data over 18 selected areas had been examined with a view to investigating the feasibility of vegetation mapping with ERS-1 .
In the future , research methodologies would be tested for monitoring deforestation , and other data sources , such as SPOT and ATSR-2 , would be examined .
In 1992 , the Panamazonia Project was proposed with the objective of developing a system for monitoring the tropical forest in Latin America using satellite remote sensing . An experienced technical team was selected from agencies in Bolivia , Brazil , Chile , Colombia , Ecuador , French Guyana , Peru and Venezuela .
Visible , near-infrared and short-wave infrared images had shown significant environmental damage as a result of deforestation .
It was anticipated that , in the near future , the Panamazonia Project would also provide data on the exploitation of mineral resources .
Considering the magnitude of the losses caused by natural disasters and recognizing the need for a global initiative , the United Nations proclaimed , by resolution 44 / 236 of 22 December 1989 , the 1990s the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction
Whereas natural disasters included floods , earthquakes , hurricanes , landslides and certain types of widely spreading infectious diseases , human-induced disasters included explosions , armed conflicts , motor and aircraft accidents , chemical spills etc .
Forest fires could be of either category .
Space technology offered tremendous potential for assisting in disaster response and mitigation .
Telecommunications satellites addressed issues related to mass awareness , warning , education and training , as well as emergency communication in the event of a disaster .
Remote sensing satellites were useful in formulating disaster mitigation measures and in monitoring , and could assist in risk analyses by promoting understanding of the processes that led to natural disasters .
A national risk assessment system was evolving in India to minimize the harmful effects of hazardous events .
That was a national mission , integrating space applications along with other relevant information for disaster warning , disaster mitigation and efficient management of hazardous events .
Unfortunately , only a few countries had the means to operationally utilize space technology for hazard management .
Increasing access to space technology for such uses could be promoted through appropriate international coordination and cooperation .
Fire was the most common natural cause of forest destruction in Canada .
Several projects were in progress to monitor the extent of such damage .
The most advanced forest management information systems were those currently being used to enhance the effectiveness of fire-suppression activities .
Many of those systems made use of satellite remote-sensing data to categorize the fuel type , which was an important factor in determining the risk that a fire would spread .
Combining the fuel type with other parameters enabled fire-suppression authorities to combat forest fires more effectively , thereby dramatically reducing annual losses and achieving significant savings in fire-suppression costs .
Several projects using remote sensing in North America were related to monitoring forest damage caused by forest fires and insect infestations .
Decision support systems were being developed to provide risk assessment and management planning to minimize losses caused by insects .
In many such projects , remote sensing was used as a tool to acquire information related to damage caused by insects .
Geographic Information Systems ( GIS ) were used to perform spatial analyses and to produce risk maps in all of those projects .
II . OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS The importance of merging space technology with other conventional techniques was stressed throughout the Workshop .
The space sector should therefore not be considered in isolation .
Space technology in developing countries should be related to use by the public sector , namely for telecommunications , remote sensing , meteorology and navigation .
Space science should continue to play a vital role , as even a modest investment in that area could pay big dividends .
Space science was well recognized as a valuable contributor to the advancement of technology , particularly in the area of data processing .
Competence in space science contributed to competence in areas far beyond the specific field of research undertaken .
It was agreed that the Workshop would help to increase awareness of the status and possibilities of applications of space technology in developing countries .
However , one impediment to the introduction of space technology in developing countries was the lack of awareness and understanding on the part of political leaders and senior officials , which often resulted in a lack of political will .
To overcome that difficulty , it would be helpful to select a few good people who had been involved in successful programmes as &quot; ambassadors &quot; to developing countries .
Their credibility would probably have a great impact .
It was important to balance space technology with the capabilities and resources of developing countries .
Many aid projects provided expensive technology to developing countries that could not sustain such systems after the initial project was concluded .
Fundamentally , every country must have its own policy to initiate and integrate space projects into its national programmes .
It was recommended that a step-by-step approach be taken to the introduction of space technology .
Although there was already a large market in developing countries for space technology products , and opportunities existed for joint ventures , more consideration should be given to building up the infrastructure required to successfully implement space programmes .
The importance of having staff that were not only trained , but competent and confident in dealing with all aspects of the applications of space technology , was stressed .
Technological advances must be accompanied by similar progress in the level of understanding of users .
However , while national space coordinating bodies were needed at senior levels to set policy , not every country needed a space agency .
In order to facilitate the implementation of space programmes , international cooperation between developed and developing countries , as well as among developing countries themselves , still needed to be improved .
It was repeatedly recommended that the practical use of satellite data with emphasis being placed on developing simple-to-use and low-cost applications should be promoted in developing countries .
Better access to Internet services should be available for developing countries .
Information on health , remote sensing and GIS was especially useful , and every institution interested in such information should have access to it .
There was a need for better standards and a more liberal approach to pricing in the area of commercial telecommunications .
In that context , international organizations such as the International Telecommunication Union , but also the operators of local platform transmitter terminals ( PTTs ) , should be encouraged to be more liberal in their pricing structures .
To achieve a national commitment to provide resources to space technology , a clear cost-benefit analysis for each project should be prepared for decision makers .
Decision makers in developing countries must be convinced that a judicious expenditure of limited resources on space programmes would substantially contribute to social stability and economic growth .
The need was stressed for participants to pass on their experience to their colleagues , and in particular to decision makers in their home countries .
Furthermore , participants should inform their local PTTs and industries of the discussions and results of the Workshop .
One of the future UN / IAF Workshops should focus on the means of overcoming the regulatory , legal , political , financial and educational obstacles to the better exploitation of space technology in developing countries .
The involvement of the private sector in such meetings should be increased .
In particular , the participation of PTTs and medium-sized companies ( of 20 to 100 employees ) , which could provide relatively low-cost technology and services to developing countries , should be encouraged .
The potential of space technology for improving traditional public health-care services was recognized by participants .
Space technology had a vital role to play in enhancing medical services , medical consulta-tions and the monitoring of epidemic disease , particularly in remote and rural areas .
Recent improvements in satellite communications technology and information systems had resulted in a dramatic increase in telehealth programmes and projects worldwide .
Linking remote locations to an urban medical centre provided an opportunity for specialist consultations that might not be possible otherwise .
Thus , telehealth systems could reduce critical delays in the delivery of health care by providing and expanding access to remote areas .
Whereas some telehealth applications required real-time capability ( video conferences for telesurgery , telepsychiatry etc . ) , other applications , such as image and file transfer , consultations or research , could be supported in a store-and-forward mode .
In the future , telehealth using mobile satellite communications systems such as Inmarsat could form an integral part of national or regional emergency planning .
Developing countries should give higher priority to active participation in , and the application of , space technology in the fields of health care and education .
They should also improve their health care and educational organizations and infrastructures .
The direct and active participation of medical universities in the use and promotion of space technology was critical in public health education and remote medical instruction .
The United Nations and other international organizations could influence policies leading to the development of telehealth and distance education systems where needed .
Current and future satellite systems could do much to rectify the knowledge imbalance that existed in many parts of the world .
However , not only technical , but also regulatory , legal and political issues must be addressed and resolved if support services for health care and education were to be developed . Those issues should not be allowed to inhibit the development of adequate , worldwide satellite services that were already feasible .
The unique capabilities of remote sensing satellites for providing comprehensive , synoptic and multi-temporal coverage of large areas at regular intervals had been and would be an indispensable tool for continuous environmental monitoring .
Although many developing countries had indigenous experts in space applications , it was nevertheless difficult for them to solve environmental problems on their own .
Outside assistance and expert advice was therefore essential to the successful application of space technology for sustainable development .
A more effective coordination policy must be established in many developing countries in order to integrate satellite remote sensing into national , social and economic development programmes .
There were examples of highly qualified individuals in well-equipped remote sensing laboratories who were not contributing to national plans because of the lack of communication with national policy makers and decision makers , who were thus not aware of the benefits that space applications could bring to national efforts to achieve sustainable development .
The pricing and independence of remote sensing data were critical for the integration of remote sensing into national programmes .
Governments and agencies should therefore be encouraged to reduce prices on remote sensing data and to reduce copyright restrictions .
In connection with the joint TREES project of the Commission of the European Communities and ESA , a deforestation monitoring system should be developed , combining low- and high-resolution data and using the Tropical Forest Information System .
Only a few developing countries currently had telecommunications systems capable of coping with disasters .
Furthermore , traditional telecommunications systems were often severely affected by disasters such as earthquakes , floods or hurricanes .
Mobile satellite systems should therefore be used .
Voice , fax and data terminals should continue to be positioned at strategic locations so that an uninterruptible source of warning would be available even if the local radio or television infrastructure had been disabled by a disaster .
A network of terminals would be particularly effective if it were connected to an appropriate regional or global database of GIS or of relevant disaster information .
In many developing countries , land mines presented a serious obstacle to social and economic development .
The process of de-mining was very slow , tedious and dangerous .
Thus , it was recommended that satellite remote sensing should be increasingly used in order to help affected developing countries deal with that problem in a more effective manner .
The continuous establishment of training centres would play a vital role in promoting and applying space technology for sustainable development .
It was suggested that remote sensing and GIS training be combined into one national training centre .
It was also recommended that such centres should train staff from different institutions , so as to encourage information sharing , reduce the amount of overlapping , and minimize the capital investment required.Annex

1 . A mobile receiving station which is capable of receiving data from the ERS-1 and ERS-2 radar satellites has been operational at Libreville , Gabon , since late 1994 .
The coverage of the station is a roughly circular geographical zone centred on Libreville which extends , to the north-west , as far as eastern Mali , and to the south-west , as far as the western regions of Zambia .
The territories of 23 African countries , of which 17 are francophone , are either wholly or predominantly covered by the Libreville station .
The near-equatorial location of the receiving station and the cloud-penetration characteristics of radar render the station particularly useful to those countries whose exploitation of conventional optical remote sensing data has been severely hampered due to the presence of heavy cloud cover , which often obstructs observation of the ground in equatorial zones .
2 . The objective of the training course was to provide participants with the knowledge and skills necessary to use radar data in a number of application areas that correspond with major regional and national interests , in particular those pertaining to agriculture , forestry , geology , mineral exploration and land use .
Knowledge of radar image interpretation is becoming increasingly important because of the growing number of operational and planned radar satellites ( e.g. ERS-1 , ERS-2 , JERS-1 , Radarsat ) and the attendant increasing use of spaceborne radar as a tool to monitor tropical regions .
The training course was co-sponsored by the European Space Agency ( ESA ) and the United Nations . It was held at Libreville , Gabon , from 15 to 19 May 1995 , for the benefit of francophone countries within the region served by the receiving station .
3 . The present report includes descriptions of the organization of the training course and enumerates the recommendations for follow-up action .
In particular , it details plans for a number of projects of regional interest and scope which were elaborated by the participants themselves .
The report has been prepared for the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and its Scientific and Technical Subcommittee .
Participants are expected to report to the relevant authorities in their countries . B. Organization and programme
4 . Application forms and information on the training course were sent out in September 1994 by the United Nations to offices of the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) for onward transmission to national authorities in 13 countries within the region : Angola , Benin , Burkina Faso , Cameroon , Central African Republic , Chad , Congo , C√¥te d &apos;Ivoire , Gabon , Mali , Niger , Togo and Zaire .
5 . The training course was attended by 25 participants , 12 of whom were from Gabon .
The other 13 participants were from the following nine countries : Benin , Burkina Faso , Cameroon , Central African Republic , Chad , Congo , Gabon , Niger and Senegal .
Other participants were from the Office for Outer Space Affairs , ESA , German Aerospace Research Establishment ( DLR ) , Scot Conseil and Groupement pour le d√©veloppement de la t√©l√©d√©tection a√©rospatiale ( GDTA ) .
6 . Funds for the participation of the 13 international participants from developing countries were obtained from budgetary allocations of the United Nations and from financial support received from ESA .
The Government of Gabon provided secretarial support and local transportation for the benefit of the participants .
7 . A high official of the Ministry of Water , Forests , Post and Telecommunications , and the Environment , Mr. O. Mboulamatari , gave an address on behalf of the Government of Gabon at the opening ceremony .
Addresses were also given by the representatives of ESA , UNDP and the Office for Outer Space Affairs .
The Minister of Water , Forests , Post and Telecommunications , and the Environment received the representatives of ESA and the Office for Outer Space Affairs together with nine high-ranking ministry officials .
This ceremony as well as those of the opening and closing of the training course were covered by the local radio , newspaper and television media .
8 . The programme of the training course ( see annex I ) was developed by the United Nations in consultation with ESA .
The course was conducted through a series of lectures and practical exercises which emphasized the use of ERS data but did not exclude discussion of other satellite radar systems .
On the last day of the training course , formal presentations were made followed by discussion of regional projects prepared by the participants in working groups for which access to and the use of ERS data would be a key element .
One of the highlights of the course was a visit to the Libreville ERS receiving station , which was conducted by Mr. K. Reiniger of DLR , and followed a visit to the Ariane tracking station , conducted by Mr. Audegean of the Centre national d &apos;√©tudes spatiales ( CNES ) , the French space agency .
9 . The principal instructor of the training course was Mr. M. Fea of ESA .
Supplementary technical presentations were made by the representatives of DLR , GDTA , Scot Conseil and the Office for Outer Space Affairs .
A concise summary of the major topics presented during the training course is given in section I , below .
This is followed , in section II , by a presentation of the recommendations of a number of working groups .
In addition to informal comments communicated to the United Nations during the course , a formal course-evaluation session ( see section III , below ) was held on the last day of the training course to gather input which would be useful for identifying future activities which would respond best to the needs of countries in the region . The proposed plan of follow-up activities is presented in section IV , below .
I. SUMMARY OF PRESENTATIONS A. European remote sensing satellites and instrumentation 10 . There are currently two ERS satellites in operation , ERS-1 and ERS-2 , launched in July 1991 and April 1995 , respectively .
Both satellites are equipped with microwave ( radar ) instrumentation which penetrates cloud cover and darkness and provides information 24 hours a day .
The satellites measure many parameters which are not currently measured by existing satellite systems .
ERS data , when used either alone or in conjunction with other data , are particularly useful in the following applications : oceanography , glaciology , meteorology , forestry , soils , agriculture and hydrology .
11 . The principal instruments on board the satellites include ( a ) an Active Microwave Instrument ( AMI ) , which comprises a synthetic aperture radar ( SAR ) and a wind scatterometer ; ( b ) a radar altimeter ( RA ) ; ( c ) an along-track scanning radiometer ( ATSR ) , which comprises an infrared radiometer ( IRR ) and a microwave sounder ( MWS ) ; ( d ) precise range and range-rate equipment ( PRARE ) , presently functioning only on ERS-2 ; and ( e ) a laser retroreflector .
In addition , the ERS-2 mission contains the global ozone monitoring experiment ( GOME ) , which provides atmospheric chemistry measurements ( ozone and other gases ) and an improved ATSR instrument that includes three visible channels .
It also allows the derivation of digital elevation models ( topographic maps ) .
In wave mode , SAR is used to measure ocean-wave spectra and wave direction , while in scatterometer mode , AMI is used to measure wind direction and speed at the ocean surface .
The radar altimeter permits the measurement of wind speed , wave height , sea-surface elevation , ice profile , land and ice topography , and sea-ice boundaries .
ATSR is used to measure the surface temperatures of the sea , land and clouds .
It is also used in the measurement of cloud cover , aerosols , vegetation , atmospheric water vapour and liquid water content .
PRARE on ERS-2 provides precise corrections of altimeter measurements .
The laser retroreflector is a passive optical device used as a target by ground-based laser ranging stations in order to determine the accurate position of the satellite.1
13 . The participants from countries in the equatorial regions of Africa showed the greatest interest in the terrestrial applications of images obtained using the SAR instrument .
In image mode , the SAR instrument acquires strips of images 100 km in width to the right of the satellite track .
The ground spatial resolution is 25 m .
It is different from optical sensors in that it operates within a frequency range , designated C-band , at a nominal frequency of 5.3 GHz with vertical transmission and vertical reception of radar signals ( VV polarization ) and a look angle of 23 degrees .
14 . ERS-1 has a sun-synchronous , near polar , quasi-circular orbit with a mean altitude of 785 km and an inclination of 98.5 degrees .
It has a 35-day repeat cycle with a re-visit period of 16-18 days . Its orbital cycle is 101 minutes .
The data transmission rate for the SAR instrument is 105 megabits per second . On-board recorders cannot be used to store SAR data , which can only be transmitted to receiving stations when these are in sight .
ERS-2 is similar in operation to ERS-1 .
Following the commissioning phase of ERS-2 , the two satellites will operate in tandem with ERS-2 following ERS-1 at a separation time of 1 day .
This time of separation is subject to change .
It is planned to maintain the ground track between the two satellites at 50-600 metres in order to improve opportunities for interferometric applications .
B. Interpretation of European remote sensing satellite data for applications of national interest
15 . Radar remote sensing from space has a number of advantages over airborne radar .
Unlike spaceborne radar where the incidence angle changes very little , in airborne applications there is a large change in incidence angle across the image swath , which causes difficulty in distinguishing whether changes in backscatter are related simply to changes in incident angle or to changes in the geometry and / or the materials themselves .
The look angle for the ERS satellites is 23 degrees ( the local angle of incidence on the ground is slightly greater than this due to the curvature of Earth ) .
At this look angle , radar backscatter is strongly influenced by topographic slope .
Hence , surface features which give rise to changes in topography , e.g. geological lineaments which may indicate mineral occurrences , are more easily interpretable using spaceborne imagery .
Nevertheless , effects such as radar shadowing , layover ( relief displacement ) and foreshortening can complicate the visual interpretation of imagery of areas of rugged terrain .
16 . Radar backscatter is dominated by the geometrical and electrical properties of surface materials , a fact which must be taken into account during the interpretation of radar images .
Materials of varying roughness - a factor which is dependent on the particular radar wavelength being used - reflect the radar signal in different ways .
Rough surfaces cause diffuse reflections in all directions and a significant portion of the signal is returned to the sensor .
Smooth surfaces result in specular reflection with practically all of the signal being reflected away from the sensor .
Very high return signals occur when adjacent smooth surfaces form right angles , which cause a double reflection and hence high return signals to the sensor .
This occurs naturally , for example , in the case of tree trunks standing in swampy , water-logged areas .
17 . The electrical character of surface material , as indicated by its complex dielectric constant , is also critical in the interpretation of radar images .
Radar reflectivity is considerably increased in the presence of water , which has a dielectric constant greater than 10 times that of dry materials .
This characteristic makes radar imagery especially useful in differentiating areas of dry from moist soil and in the identification of vegetated zones often characterized by high humidity that would give rise to a strong radar response .
18 . Radar reflection from vegetation is also influenced by the type of polarization .
In general , like-polarized signals , such as the VV polarization of the ERS instruments , are better at penetrating vegetation than crossed-polarized signals .
While ERS and Radarsat satellites operate in the C-band , JERS-1 operates in the longer L-band .
Radar penetration of vegetation - forests and agricultural crops - is influenced by the wavelength of the signal .
Shorter wavelengths may be scattered by the tree canopy , however , longer wavelengths tend to penetrate it and be reflected by the underlying soil .
The use of radar images of multiple wavelengths from multiple space platforms ( e.g. ERS / Radarsat , JERS-1 , Shuttle Imaging Radar / Seasat ) can therefore provide more information and allow for better differentiation in certain land-cover and forestry studies .
19 . In general , through a knowledge of the interdependence of the factors which have a major influence on radar response ( e.g. incidence angle , moisture content , surface roughness , geometry and slope orientation ) , ERS imagery corresponding to a single date can be interpreted for a variety of terrestrial applications .
These applications can be placed in one or more of the following categories : ( a ) feature identification , ( b ) determination of the spatial extent of a feature of interest , ( c ) detection of change , e.g. deforestation , and ( d ) quantitative determination of biogeophysical parameters , e.g. soil-water content .
20 . The interpretation of ERS imagery can be facilitated by digital enhancement procedures ( filtering , colour coding etc . ) that serve to highlight particular features of interest .
Radar images are often characterized by speckle , which appears as a salt-and-pepper pattern .
This effect is due to random constructive and destructive interference of radar waves that results in a random pattern of light and dark areas on the imagery .
Speckle can be reduced by application of appropriate digital filtering or multi-look processing procedures .
The reduction of speckle is a necessary precursor to computer classification of radar imagery as well as to visual interpretation since it tends to mask fine details .
21 . In addition to the various possible enhancement of imagery from a single date , images from multiple dates can be exploited to yield new information , e.g. change detection .
A single image from a given date may not be sufficient to differentiate several different crop types .
However , two or more images acquired at different times during the growing season may allow differentiation of crop cover .
Soils whose moisture content evolves differently during the year may be differentiated using multiple-date images .
22 . In instances when both optical and radar satellite images are available , the two can be merged to exploit the complementarity that exists between the two data sets .
Techniques for merging optical and radar data , such as the construction of colour composites and intensity-hue-saturation ( IHS ) transformations , can be employed to emphasize or de-emphasize surface features while retaining information from both data sets .
Such merging operations must overcome difficulties of image co-registration , i.e. the accurate matching of common features appearing on both images when these are superimposed .
For this reason , in areas of appreciable relief , a digital elevation model is used during registration to correct for relief displacements .
23 . The technique of interferometry , by which the &quot; phase &quot; difference associated with a given pixel from two SAR images is analysed , allows for precise determination of elevation .
The preparation of precise topographic maps from SAR images is therefore possible .
Differential interferometry also allows for the monitoring of volcanic eruptions and earthquakes .
C. Data access and processing
24 . Information on the availability of processed ERS data collected at the Libreville station and archived at the DLR facility at Oberpfaffenhofen , Germany , is readily available using a software program called DESC developed by ESA .
The program allows interactive searching of a database to find and identify image frames which correspond to a geographic region of interest .
This database is periodically updated by ESA and distributed to registered users .
Updates can also be obtained electronically via the Internet .
25 . The high volumes of data associated with digital processing ( e.g. geocoding , enhancements ) of ERS images necessitate access to fairly powerful PC-based systems with software capable of processing and displaying 16-bit ERS images .
In addition , the production of high-quality prints of the digitally enhanced images would require access to large-format printers .
The high costs inherent in the acquisition of these items of equipment may put digital image processing of radar data out of the reach of some African institutions .
However , the preparation of large-scale photographic prints of ERS images may be more cost-effective if it is initially left to service companies in Europe and elsewhere .
II . RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE WORKING GROUPS
26 . Based on the potential usefulness of satellite radar data as presented during the training course , the participants identified a number of projects which could benefit from the radar data collected at the Libreville receiving station .
Some of these projects are already ongoing and involve the institutions to which the participants are attached .
The remainder are newly conceived project proposals .
The projects listed represent the output of three working groups , corresponding to each of the three application themes .
These groups were constituted specifically to discuss national and regional development issues and to identify specific target activities which can benefit from the exploitation of ERS data .
The working groups also made a number of recommendations which aim at enhancing the use of ERS data by countries within the region .
These recommendations are aimed at all relevant entitites , including the United Nations , Governments and space agencies , whose timely interventions may serve to improve the present situation .
The recommendations have been synthesized and are as follows :
( a ) Participants should have access to more in-depth training on detailed radar image interpretation .
In general , while a one-week training course is good for a general introduction to radar , a course lasting approximately three weeks is needed to develop the technical confidence needed to use the data on an operational basis ;
( b ) A follow-up training course should be organized to share operational experiences on applications of ERS data and to consolidate technical concepts introduced during the present course ;
( c ) Countries within the region should have access to the ERS images collected by the Libreville station ;
( d ) Cooperation between South-South and North-South in matters related to ERS data should be promoted and strengthened ;
( e ) Training should be given in Geographic Information Systems ( GIS ) technology and the integration of radar and other remote sensing data in GIS systems ;
( f ) Countries within the region should have access to technical assistance in matters related to the exploitation of radar images within an operational setting ;
( g ) National and regional institutions should be invited to participate in the demonstration studies of ERS data from the Libreville station .
27 . There is as yet limited experience on the use of satellite radar images in tropical regions .
For this reason , the operational usefulness of ERS data in African countries needs to be demonstrated .
Necessarily , such a demonstration should involve African institutions and professionals who are knowledgeable of ground conditions and can attest to the usefulness and applicability of the radar data under their local conditions .
28 . As illustrated in annex II , the problems which have already been encountered in existing projects or those that are envisaged in proposed ones concern the presence of heavy cloud cover on conventional optical satellite images .
Thus , a principal need is adequate access to the radar images which have been collected by the ERS station at Libreville .
29 . Only a few of the participants came from institutions which possessed the computer hardware and software needed for digital processing of voluminous ERS radar .
Consequently , there was considerable discussion on ways in which to gain immediate access to the paper prints of digital images which would be suitably enhanced so as to highlight particular features of thematic interest , e.g. geology , land use and land cover , agriculture and forestry .
In that regard , it appears that private companies in Europe which already have experience in the digital processing and enhancement of ERS data as well as in their photographic reproduction may be used to create large-scale photomaps .
Such maps could easily be used at the present time by all of the countries represented at the training course .
An eventual progression towards the digital processing and printing of ERS images is , however , highly desirable , particularly by participants from those national institutions which already have several years of experience in digital image analysis .
III . COURSE EVALUATION
30 . Suggestions abstracted from the evaluation sheets filled in by the participants are as follows :
( a ) Access to more detailed training ( lasting at least 10 days ) is highly desirable , in association with national or international entities experienced in the specific area of application ;
( b ) The course should devote more time for practical exercises ;
( c ) French documentation on ERS radar applications in all themes of interest should be made available ;
( d ) A wider distribution of information concerning training courses should be made available well ahead of their scheduling ;
( e ) Consideration should be given in order to avoid problems of distribution , to making direct contact with the national agencies or contact persons concerned , perhaps using electronic means , in addition to the normal official channels ;
( f ) The United Nations and ESA should maintain contact with the participants after the course in order to keep them abreast of developments in satellite radar technology ;
( g ) A follow-up meeting should be held in one or two years ;
( h ) Access should be given to training on digital analysis of radar images .
IV . PROPOSED FOLLOW-UP PLAN OF ACTION
31 . The Office for Outer Space Affairs together with ESA propose to respond to the recommendations of the working groups and the various comments made during the course evaluation by undertaking the following activities :
( a ) A number of projects will be selected from among those already proposed by the participants for possible assistance .
In this regard , more detailed proposals than those elaborated during the course will be solicited from the participants in order to evaluate properly the relative merits of the various proposals and to facilitate the selection , on a competitive basis , of a number of projects worthy of support ;
( b ) Subsequently , arrangements will be made for supporting the selected projects within the framework of an assistance programme currently being developed jointly by the Office for Outer Space Affairs and ESA .
As envisaged , this programme will provide limited support ( e.g. training , access to satellite images and selected items of equipment needed for image interpretation ) for ongoing activities ;
( c ) Expansion of the distribution of information related to the scheduling of the various training programmes and workshops organized each year by the Office for Outer Space Affairs will be made progressively to include selected national institutions whose activities may benefit from the application of space technology .
Priority will be given to information distribution by electronic means ( e.g. e-mail ) ;
Specifically , the names of all course participants has been put on the ESA mailing list to receive the Earth Observation Quarterly .
In addition , ESA has mailed copies of the DESC software program to all participants . ) ;
( e ) A follow-up advanced training course / seminar will be held involving participants who will have used ERS data from the Libreville station in an operational setting .

A. Astronomy and space physics
During Fiscal Year 1994 ( FY 1994 ) , space scientists continued to add to the fund of information about the universe gathered not only through instruments located on Earth , but also from those on satellites above the distorting medium of the home planet &apos;s atmosphere .
For example , scientists working on the Hubble Space Telescope team made a number of important discoveries during FY 1994 , including images of an exploding star ( Nova Cygni 1992 ) .
Many of these findings preceded the highly successful servicing mission in December 1993 when astronauts on STS-61 replaced several faulty parts and installed a sophisticated package of corrective optics to compensate for the spherical aberration in HST &apos;s primary mirror .
Coin-sized mirrors on the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 and Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacements units have since served as &quot; contact lenses &quot; for HST .
While the telescope has always had a view of the sky unobstructed by haze from the Earth , scientists since have been able to accomplish all the astronomical goals initially planned for the most sophisticated observatory ever built .
In the process , HST &apos;s first servicing mission proved the capability of NASA &apos;s highly trained astronauts to work productively in space .
As one fruit of their efforts , an astronomer from the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory ( SAO ) , heading an international team , used HST &apos;s Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 in May 1994 to obtain valuable new images of Supernova 1994I , discovered by amateur astronomers in April 1994 in the inner regions of the &quot; Whirlpool Galaxy , &quot; M51 .
HST has the unique capability of imaging and measuring the spectra of distant supernovae in ultraviolet light .
As the M51 supernova ages , Hubble will &quot; see &quot; more deeply into the interior of the exploding star .
This will permit astronomers to probe the chemical composition of the debris and learn more about the type of star that exploded .
The team of scientists hope thereby to learn which stars explode as supernovae , what chemical elements are ejected , and how to use these bright events as yardsticks for measuring the size of the universe .
In June 1994 , two scientists using the HST discovered disks of protoplanetary dust around stars in the Orion Nebula region of the Milky Way galaxy .
This revelation indicates that the formation of planets may be relatively common both in the Milky Way and in other parts of the universe .
The newly found disks contain many of the same basic chemicals that compose the planets in our solar system .
Because planets are the only heavenly bodies that can support life as we know it , the existence of planets around other stars would raise the likelihood of life in other parts of the universe .
Then in July 1994 , an international team of astronomers using HST &apos;s Faint Object Camera confirmed that helium is widespread throughout the early universe , a key hypothesis of the Big Bang theory .
The discovery of helium in the constellation of Cetus , which is 13 billion light years away , gives scientists valuable information about conditions at the time of the universe &apos;s initial evolution .
Additionally , this finding lends further weight to the scientists &apos; conception of chemical evolution in the universe ; scientists believe that hydrogen and helium evolved within three minutes after the Big Bang , while heavier elements such as oxygen and carbon came later .
In other developments , scientists analyzing data from the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory ( CGRO ) , which was launched in April 1991 , found new evidence that gamma-ray bursts extend into the far reaches of the universe and thus bear an imprint of the universe &apos;s expansion .
These huge explosions come from all directions , suggesting a cosmological cause ; until this discovery it was believed that the bursts were limited to within the Milky Way galaxy .
Because the bursts come from so far away , they demonstrate &quot; time dilation , &quot; an effect created when time seems to be running more slowly at the bursts &apos; source than at their destination , since the universe itself is thought to be expanding .
Relatedly , the CGRO &apos;s Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope ( EGRET ) provided the first detailed all sky map of highly energetic gamma ray objects , pointing out several different types of gamma ray sources .
Scientists believe , for example , that the interactions of cosmic ray particles with gas between the stars produce diffuse gamma ray emissions from our Milky Way galaxy .
Within this band are gamma ray pulsars and other unidentified sources of gamma rays .
Astronomers analyzing EGRET &apos;s data have also identified what they think are massive black holes in the middle of distant galaxies that are sending gamma rays in Earth &apos;s direction .
Similarly , the Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer ( EUVE ) , launched in June 1992 , produced the first all-sky map in four extreme ultraviolet wavelength bands .
This survey has identified large numbers of very hot stars such as white dwarfs and active corona stars .
For purposes of comparison , scientists also surveyed a companion area along half the ecliptic plane on which Earth travels around the Sun .
Space physicists using the Solar , Anomalous , and Magnetospheric Particle Explorer ( SAMPEX ) , launched in June 1992 , discovered a radiation belt of trapped anomalous cosmic rays in the magnetosphere .
They have determined the chemical composition and electrical charge of these rays in the region beyond the Earth &apos;s upper atmosphere where the planet &apos;s magnetic field affects charged particles .
In addition , these scientists have learned a lot about the effects of electrons in the upper atmosphere .
SAMPEX &apos;s mission is to monitor energetic electrons and atomic ions from the Sun and from interplanetary , interstellar , and magnetospheric space .
Space physicists also achieved breakthroughs in computer modeling .
In particular , complex numerical modeling has led to a detailed conception of the Earth &apos;s magnetosphere .
As a result , scientists are now able to predict &quot; space weather &quot; caused by solar-terrestrial interactions .
Investigators using computer simulations have also gained a refined understanding of the heliopause , the boundary of the solar system where the solar wind &apos;s outward flow is balanced by the pressure of the interstellar medium .
SPARTAN 201-2 , a small satellite deployed and then retrieved several days later by the Space Shuttle Discovery in September 1994 , examined the Sun &apos;s hot outer atmosphere , or extended corona , and the solar wind , the flow of charged ions from the Sun .
On its second of four planned missions aboard the Shuttle , SPARTAN contained two instruments--the NASA-designed White Light Coronograph to measure the density and distribution of the electrons in the coronal holes and polar plumes of the Sun and the Ultraviolet Coronal Spectrometer , designed by the SAO .
Together , the two instruments can determine the velocity of the solar wind as it accelerates out of the Sun so that scientists can grasp exactly how and when the Sun creates this wind as well as what the shape and spectroscopy of the solar corona may be .
The measurements made by SPARTAN 201 will be used in conjunction with those from the Ulysses spacecraft , which was launched in October 1990 and which detected the solar wind from the south polar corona as SPARTAN observed the source region of that wind as well as other portions of the Sun &apos;s corona .
Data from SPARTAN 201 will also calibrate measurements to be made by the European Space Agency ( ESA ) -NASA Solar and Heliospheric Observatory , scheduled for launch in 1995 .
Scientists hope to derive practical information from these missions about exactly how the solar wind produces magnetic storms near the Earth that can disrupt communication systems and trigger power outages , resulting in losses estimated at $ 100 million each year worldwide .
Ulysses , meanwhile , became the first spacecraft to fly over a polar region of the Sun when , in June 1994 , it began its primary mission to observe the solar wind at high-solar latitudes .
Built by ESA and equipped with both European and United States instruments , Ulysses will take direct measurements of many complex solar phenomena that cannot be observed remotely .
Scientists are eager to learn more about the Sun &apos;s polar magnetic fields , which reverse polarity every 11 years in conjunction with the solar cycle ; they play an important role in the Sun &apos;s corona and solar wind .
The ionic composition of the solar wind , measured by Ulysses , indicates that its source in the coronal gas measures just over a million degrees Centigrade .
This is not hot enough to make the wind go as fast as it does , indicating that some unknown electromagnetic process near the Sun is responsible for accelerating the solar wind .
In a separate development , researchers from the University of Alaska in Fairbanks recorded spectacular upper atmospheric flashes occurring above electrical thunderstorms .
For many years , pilots have noticed these bright blue and red flashes that last only a few thousandths of a second .
Using special low-light-level cameras mounted on two small aircraft , scientists recently captured these flashes on video for the first time .
They extended upward as high as 100 kilometers and some even reached through the Earth &apos;s ozone layer to the ionosphere .
After coordinating their measurements with scientists at other institutions , the researchers came to suspect that the flashes are a form of electrical discharge .
The scientists plan further study to understand the origin of the flashes and their potential impact on aircraft safety .
More broadly , this phenomenon links the weather in the Earth &apos;s lower atmosphere to upper atmospheric layers that form our planet &apos;s border to space .
In other weather-related space science , NASA conducted a series of sounding rocket flights during FY 1994 to examine the Alaskan auroras .
Space physicists are interested in these colorful phenomena known as &quot; Northern Lights &quot; because they are caused by variations in the solar wind &apos;s interaction with the Earth &apos;s magnetic field .
Equipped with sophisticated payloads , sounding rockets flew directly through the auroras , allowing scientists to take direct measurements of the ions &apos; energy levels .
Researchers hope to gain a better understanding of how these particles are accelerated and energized .
This campaign of eight rocket flights formed a significant part of the Space Physics Division &apos;s 41 rocket flights this fiscal year .
Because of their extreme luminosity at maximum light , Type Ia supernovae have proved themselves to be valuable in measuring both the local rate of expansion of the universe and the rate of change of that expansion .
Recent work by Mark Phillips of the Cerro-Tolodo Interamerican Observatory in Chile has shown that there is a significant spread in the intrinsic radiated energy in visible light of this key subtype of supernova .
That spread can introduce a bias in samples of distant supernovae , leading to erroneous estimates of universal deceleration .
Phillips and his collaborators found a good correlation between the rate of decline with time of the luminous output of supernovae and their peak brightness .
The strength of the spectral features can be used to increase the accuracy of the estimate of each supernova &apos;s intrinsic brightness and therefore , its distance .
The use of this technique now places supernovae among the most accurate of the standard candles , suitable for use as distant probes measuring features of the early universe .
A series of systematic observations by astronomers has long suggested the existence of a &quot; Great Attractor , &quot; a concentration of mass that causes a bulk flow of galaxies toward it .
Scientists discovered this large-scale flow by comparing the motion of the local group with respect to clusters versus the motion with respect to the cosmic microwave background , which is assumed to be a &quot; stationary &quot; reference .
The strength of such large-scale flows can distinguish among models that explain the formulation of galaxies and clusters in the early universe .
More recently , astronomers have begun to examine large volumes of space to search for structure and flows on even larger scales .
Work by Todd R. Lauer ( National Optical Astronomy Observatories ) and Marc Postman ( Space Telescope Science Institute ) , using the Kitt Peak National Observatory &apos;s 4- and 2.1-meter telescopes in Arizona and the Cerro-Tolodo Interamerican Observatory &apos;s 1.5-meter telescope in Chile , suggests that bulk flows can be identified over scales as large as some 600 million light-years , almost three times larger than those found in previous investigations .
They used the brightest galaxies to measure the distances and velocities of 119 clusters , creating the cluster reference frame .
The motion of the local group of galaxies derived with respect to these galaxy clusters was significantly different from the one derived with respect to the cosmic microwave background .
The most straightforward interpretation of this result is that all the galaxies in the volume of space defined by these clusters are streaming with a velocity of nearly 700 kilometers per second and that any &quot; attractor &quot; has to lie beyond the boundaries of the original search .
A structure this large cannot be explained by any current theoretical model and opens fruitful new directions for understanding the scale of the largest structures in the universe .
The application of seismology to the study of the solar interior has advanced almost solely by the prediction and measurement of the Sun &apos;s frequencies of oscillation .
Thomas L. Duvall ( Goddard Space Flight Center ) , Stuart Jeffries ( Bartol ) , Jack W. Harvey ( National Solar Observatory , Tucson ) and Martin A. Pomerantz ( Bartol ) have shown that it is also possible to obtain direct measurements of the travel times and distances of individual acoustic ( sound-like ) waves , which is the predominant approach in terrestrial seismology .
The basic concept is simple : At the surface , a wave propagating upward from the interior is reflected back downwards by the steep change in the density of the gas at the Sun &apos;s surface .
As the wave travels into the interior , its path is curved back toward the surface by refraction , caused by the strong increase of temperature with increasing depth .
If the upward wave causes a brightening in the area of the Sun &apos;s surface , then there will be a correlated brightening where the wave resurfaces at a later time .
By measuring this time difference as a function of the distance of separation of two surface locations , it is possible to develop a plot of the travel time versus the distance of separation , a plot familiar from terrestrial seismology .
The initial work showed that acoustic waves with frequencies of oscillation greater than a critical value predicted from the physical conditions in the solar atmosphere are not significantly reflected by the atmosphere , with less than 2-percent reflection coefficient .
This approach opens the way for seismic studies of local solar phenomena , such as inhomogeneities beneath the Sun &apos;s surface near sunspots .
It should also help refine models of the gas velocities below the Sun &apos;s surface .
Drs. Joseph Taylor and Russell Hulse of Princeton University won the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics for their discovery using the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico of the binary pulsar PSR B1913 + 16 and their subsequent monitoring and analysis of this object .
Their work demonstrated convincingly the appropriateness of general relativity as a theory of gravitation under extreme conditions and indirectly confirmed the existence of the gravitational radiation Albert Einstein had predicted .
In more recent use of the Arecibo radio telescope , continued timing of the millisecond binary pulsar PSR B1257 + 12 by its discoverer , Alexander Wolszczan of Pennsylvania State University , has greatly strengthened the case for the previously-announced pair of planets that orbit this object ; the observations have begun to show the expected effects that the planets &apos; mutual gravity has on their orbital motion .
The observations have also revealed the presence of a third planetary body , with a mass only 1.5 percent that of the Earth , that orbits the central neutron stars at a distance of only 0.2 astronomical units .
Observations of gas clouds associated with the high-redshift quasar PC 1643 + 4631A using the 42 and 12-meter radio telescopes at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory ( NRAO--Kitt Peak , Arizona ) have revealed the presence of carbon monoxide emission .
Clouds such as this have been identified previously with the progenitors of current galaxies .
The red shift of the molecular spectral lines indicates that they were emitted when the universe was about one-fifth of its present age .
The observations by David T. Frayer , NRAO associate director Robert L. Brown , and NRAO director Paul A. Venden Bout are striking in that they indicate a molecular mass of 4.5 trillion solar masses .
This equals the stellar mass of a large galaxy , but here the material apparently lies in an extended , gaseous , prestellar state .
Also noteworthy are the substantial quantities of carbon and oxygen that make up the carbon monoxide molecules ; these elements must have themselves been produced in a burst of massive star formation preceding the observed protogalactic state .
The National Science Foundation &apos;s ( NSF ) Center for Astrophysical Research in Antarctica ( CARA ) made wintertime astrophysical observations from NSF &apos;s observatory at South Pole for the first time during the austral winter of 1994 .
CARA &apos;s South Pole Infrared EXplorer ( SPIREX ) telescope was able , because of its unique location , to image more of the impacts of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 with Jupiter than any other instrument .
Also , site measurements by SPIREX confirmed that the sky at South Pole is darker by a factor of at least three than any other site previously surveyed .
Another of CARA &apos;s experiments is on the Cosmic Background Radiation Anisotropy ; at the end of the fiscal year , it consisted of a suite of two telescopes designated PYTHON and VIPER .
PYTHON has made measurements at South Pole during the past two austral summers and has now been operated for the first time during winter .
It has made important confirmation of the Cosmic Microwave Background ( CMB ) anisotropy first measured by the Cosmic Background Explorer ( COBE ) , launched in 1989 , and it has begun to make a finer scale map of the CMB than is possible with the smaller antennas of COBE .
The quiet atmospheric conditions at South Pole have allowed PYTHON to make measurements of unprecedented sensitivity .
Using new data from the Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and Astrophysics ( ASCA , launched by Japan in February 1993 ) about two supernova remnants ( designated E0519-69.0 and N103B ) in the Large Megallanic Cloud , a binational team of astronomers led by SAO &apos;s John P. Hughes discovered significant amounts of iron , calcium , and other newly synthesized elements .
ASCA gives astronomers a better tool for direct observation of the emissions from many atoms , including oxygen , silicon , calcium , and iron , in the ejected gas of supernovae , lasting for many hundreds of years after the explosion that created the supernova .
Scientists believe that the explosions which created the remnants occurred somewhere between 500 and 1,500 years ago . The obvious presence of iron emissions coupled with the lack of strong oxygen emission suggests that these remnants belong to the select group of supernova explosions that produced the bulk of the iron in the universe , according to Hughes .
Further study of the new data should help astronomers refine current models of supernova explosions and &quot; because of the ubiquitous presence of iron throughout the universe , &quot; Hughes expected the results to have a large influence on astronomy in general .
Two other SAO scientists , Dong-Woo Kim and Giuseppina Fabbiano , discovered a huge , hot , gaseous halo surrounding a distant galaxy , perhaps providing evidence for the presence of both dark matter and so-called cooling flows .
This , in turn , may shed new light on whether the universe is open or closed .
The two astronomers used the joint German-United States-U.K. x-ray satellite Roentgen Satellite ( ROSAT ) , launched in June 1990 , to observe an x-ray-bright elliptical galaxy , NGC 507 , some 300 million light years from Earth .
Measuring the temperatures of x-ray-emitting hot gas , they observed a steady decrease of heat toward the galaxy &apos;s center .
They believe this fall in temperatures may result from cooling flows in the central region .
Also , uncertainty in measurements of the mass of NGC 507 suggest that a large amount of dark matter may be present .
Observations indicate that baryonic matter ( mass seen as stars and gas in all wavelengths ) makes up some 15 percent of the estimated total mass of the galaxy .
Since current cosmological theory predicts that baryonic mass must be less than 5 percent to &quot; close &quot; the universe , this finding has implications for cosmology .
However , similar measurements of many other systems will be necessary before scientists can determine whether the universe is open or closed .
B. Solar system exploration
Closer to home , scientists were also making new discoveries about our own solar system .
For example , ground observations conducted under the Near Earth Object program detected the Shoemaker-Levy 9 comet in 1993 and predicted its impact upon Jupiter in July 1994 .
This event marked one of the more spectacular results of a detailed , long-term telescopic survey of the night sky at Palomar Observatory , California , by United States Geological Survey ( USGS ) geologist Eugene M. Shoemaker and two volunteers , Carolyn S. Shoemaker and David H. Levy .
It was the first totally disrupted ( fragmented ) comet ever to be observed , and the first to be seen orbiting and impacting a planet .
For the first time , the worldwide scientific community was able to predict and track such a crash .
A total of 21 observable fragments collided with Jupiter over a week-long period .
The impact , observed in regions of the electromagnetic spectrum ranging from the ultraviolet to long radio wavelengths , produced fireballs that left major visible marks on the planet ; it revealed a clearcut need for an inventory of comets and asteroids that may someday collide with Earth .
During the last few months of the fiscal year , scientists under contract to the Defense Nuclear Agency ( DNA ) used their expertise in simulation and modeling of the nuclear effects in the Earth &apos;s atmosphere to explain the enhanced radio emission data resulting from measurements in various radio frequency bands from Jupiter &apos;s magnetosphere during the impact .
Their findings , in line with a shock acceleration model , suggest a greater effect than had previously been assumed .
As the fiscal year ended , previous calculations were being refined in collaboration with a variety of radio and optical observers and investigators .
In anticipation of the collision of the comet with Jupiter , the Divisions of Astronomical Sciences and Atmospheric Sciences within the NSF and the Solar System Exploration Division of NASA sponsored a special program to support observational and theoretical investigations into the mechanism of energy deposition into different regions of Jupiter &apos;s atmosphere .
Theoretical models account for the amount and velocity of material ejected during the collisions as well as the chemical reactions that occur as a result of the interaction of this material with the neutral and ionized components of Jupiter &apos;s atmosphere .
The impact is expected to have generated dust that , on being charged through exposure to the plasma environment , will form new dust rings around the planet .
Data obtained from a variety of instruments strategically deployed to observe the effects of the impacts will test the theoretical predictions .
NASA scientists also made exciting new strides in lunar studies while working on the Department of Defense ( DoD ) -sponsored Clementine mission .
This effort , in which lunar research was only one of the goals , was conducted by the Naval Research Laboratory ( NRL ) with the support of NASA , Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( JPL ) in California . Launched on January 25 , 1994 , the Clementine spacecraft entered lunar orbit on February 19 , 1994 .
For the next 2 1 / 2 months , four cameras took 1.8 million images of the surface of the Moon in 11 discreet wavebands with coarse altimetry over most of the lunar surface , resulting in the first comprehensive digital map of that surface .
In addition , NASA scientists are excited to have multispectral surface data covering 11 colors in the visible and infrared spectra .
Instruments such as a laser ranger , a charged particle telescope , advanced thermal imagers , and radio tracking gear also contributed significant new information about the Moon &apos;s topography , surface composition , and charged particle environment .
For example , the lidar system compiled a complete map of lunar elevations , discovering a 12-kilometer-deep impact crater at the lunar south pole in the process .
An in-flight contrived experiment to use the communications transmitter for active , bistatic measurements produced supportive but not conclusive evidence for the existence of ice in the permanent shadows of craters near the lunar poles .
NASA planned to sponsor a series of multiyear grants to scientists to examine Clementine &apos;s lunar data in expectation of discovering new insights about the Moon &apos;s formation .
The USGS has begun processing the Clementine data to produce global digital maps , as well .
A secondary mission of Clementine , a deep-space encounter with the asteroid 1620 Geographos , could not be completed because of a problem that occurred after completion of the lunar mapping mission .
Galileo , on the other hand , did complete its encounter with the asteroid Ida and in the process made the curious discovery of the first confirmed moon around an asteroid .
This was the 1.5-kilometer-in-diameter satellite , Dactyl .
Although scientists previously believed that natural satellites of asteroids probably existed , they now contend that such moons may be more widespread than previously considered .
As the fiscal year ended researchers were busy examining data about Ida &apos;s moon to learn how both bodies were formed .
One possibility is that the moon was formed during the explosion of a larger asteroid of heterogeneous composition that also gave birth to Ida .
Spectral analysis by Galileo &apos;s near-infrared mapping spectrometer revealed that Dactyl is composed of different amounts of specific compounds than Ida , indicating that it did not come directly from Ida .
New data gathered by Galileo indicate that Ida &apos;s composition is more diverse than previously thought .
By examining the moon &apos;s orbital parameters , scientists , including those from NASA and the USGS , can better determine Ida &apos;s mass .
Combining this information with prior data on Ida &apos;s size will enable scientists to deduce the asteroid &apos;s density and composition .
While on its way to Jupiter , Galileo also examined another asteroid , Gaspra , which , like Ida , travels in the main asteroid belt orbiting the Sun between Mars and Jupiter .
In other planetary exploration , the Magellan spacecraft , launched in May 1989 , determined that Venus is still geologically active .
After completing the mapping of the planet &apos;s surface , Magellan began collecting information about its density .
By tracking the spacecraft &apos;s precise speed over specific areas of the planet , ground controllers back on Earth calculated the strength of gravity in these locations and thus the subsurface density .
The data indicate that Venusian areas of high gravity correspond to areas of high elevation , in contrast to the situation on Earth , where mountain ranges correspond to gravitational lows .
Relatedly , the USGS successfully completed the first full-resolution global radar mosaic of Venus ( 1 : 1,500,000 scale ) ; a series of 170 CD-ROMs containing the same spacecraft data was in production as the fiscal year ended .
Nearly half of the 1 : 1,500,000-scale geologic base map quadrangles have been completed to support NASA &apos;s Venus Geologic Mapping Program .
In addition , the USGS has been involved in planning for unpiloted missions NASA proposes to send to Mars , including Pathfinder ( a lander with a small rover projected for 1996-97 ) , at least two orbiters named Mars Global Surveyor , and a series of Mars Surveyor landers .
Geologists from the Survey served on the Pathfinder imaging team and helped plan for a wide range of Pathfinder experiments and geologic observations , including selection of a landing site at the mouth of a large Martian outflow channel .
Survey personnel also helped plan for Surveyor orbiter and lander missions projected to take place between 1998 and 2005 .
C. Other space science
NASA made significant strides in microgravity and life sciences research during FY 1994 , beginning with the Spacelab Life Sciences-2 ( SLS-2 ) mission in October 1993 .
Its payload consisted of 14 experiments that examined physiological responses of humans and rodents to microgravity and their subsequent readaptation to Earth &apos;s gravity .
As an extension of the SLS-1 mission in June 1991 , research on SLS-2 focused on identifying and further characterizing the changes in physiological systems during and after space flight and on increasing our knowledge about underlying mechanisms so we can minimize or counteract changes adverse to human health before the international Space Station begins its operations .
Important findings from SLS-2 included independent demonstration by three different investigator teams that current models for understanding the effects of gravity on the heart , lungs , and circulation could not predict the observed physiological responses during space flight .
These studies will yield important new understanding of blood pressure regulation , in health and disease , and of cardiopulmonary disorders .
Researchers also learned that a surprising degree of neural plasticity results from exposure to microgravity .
These results will improve our understanding of the nervous system &apos;s adaptation to change .
Research into the role that physical loading ( gravity ) plays in maintaining muscle function--combining anatomy , biochemistry , and functional measures--will help the joint NASA-National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) program in muscle physiology .
The flight of a cosmonaut on STS-60 in February 1994 began Phase 1 of the international Space Station .
In August , the first launch of United States research hardware aboard a Russian Progress rocket included an acceleration measurement system to support both United States and Russian research programs .
Additional United States hardware is being tested and shipped to Russia for launch aboard Progress rockets next year .
Ultimately , a planned International Space Research and Technology Institute will sponsor new interdisciplinary teams consisting of biologists , technologists , physicists , and material scientists to do research both on Earth and in the Space Station , bringing fresh insight and methodology to bear on problems humans face .
Meanwhile , in March 1994 NASA flew the USMP-2--a facility exposed to the space environment in the Shuttle payload bay that provides power , cooling , and data collection for a variety of experiments .
The Isothermal Dendritic Growth Experiment advanced our knowledge of materials science .
Dendrite growth is the common form of crystal growth encountered when metals , alloys , and many other materials solidify in most industrial processes .
Study of the formation of dendrites in orbit showed conclusively that in order to provide rigorous tests of fundamental theories of dendrite formation and development , long-duration , high-quality microgravity conditions are required .
These theories are needed to predict and achieve in solidified materials the desired microstructures that control many of their physical and chemical properties such as their mechanical strength and resistance to corrosion .
The Crystal Growth of Solid Solution Semiconductors Experiment , using the Advanced Automated Directional Solidification Furnace on its first mission , successfully grew a crystal of mercury cadmium telluride alloy , a semiconductor , to study the physics of additive thermal- and composition-driven convection during crystal growth .
The in-situ monitoring available in the MEPHISTO ( French--Material pour l &apos;Etude des Phenomenes Interessant la Solidification sur Terre et en Orbite ) apparatus enabled the study of transport and kinetic phenomena during crystal growth of bismuth / tin alloys .
The MEPHISTO furnace , developed by the French Space Agency and shared by United States and French investigators under a cooperative agreement , has the unique ability to study the formation of microstructures in solidifying materials to help understand how metals acquire their physical properties .
The Critical Fluid Light Scattering Experiment studied phase transition phenomena near the critical point of the element , xenon .
Studying an area known to physicists as dynamic critical phenomena , this experiment provided theorists with new guidance for modeling how systems with many degrees of freedom respond to fluctuations .
Such models can help interpret such varied phenomena as atmospheric turbulence , human population dynamics , and superconductivity .
IML-2 in July 1994 continued IML-1 &apos;s exploration of the effects of gravitational force on biological , physical , and chemical systems .
Some 82 investigations sent into orbit by 75 principal investigators from 13 countries showed how crewed space laboratories can be used with high efficiency in international investigations such as those to be done on the Space Station .
On IML-2 , 11 major United States microgravity experiments used new flight apparatuses developed by NASA &apos;s international partners .
Four United States investigator teams used the German electromagnetic containerless processing facility ( TEMPUS ) to conduct studies of nucleation in solidification while also measuring thermophysical properties . One United States investigator used ESA &apos;s Advanced Protein Crystallization Facility , flown on its first long-duration mission , to study crystallization of macromolecules using the &quot; liquid-liquid diffusion technique . &quot;
Another United States investigator successfully completed protocols to study the phenomenon of liquid-phase sintering--a process used to produce alloys of novel compositions from high-temperature materials--in the National Space Development Agency ( NASDA ) of Japan &apos;s Large Isothermal Furnace .
Two United States investigator teams studied liquid-phase interactions using ESA &apos;s Bubble , Drop , and Particle Unit , and one United States investigator group studied phase changes , employing ESA &apos;s Critical Point Facility .
Preliminary results from the mission include new insights into the transport of mass and energy in systems at vapor-liquid critical point--a unique condition of matter that promises to reveal important new understanding of complex systems on scales ranging from the atom to global weather and of subtle changes such as the magnetization of an iron bar or the way substances transition from conductivity to superconductivity ; and observations of surface-tension driven motions of drops and bubbles under conditions of strongly-coupled heat and momentum transport .
The IML-2 studies of radiation biology showed damage to living cells as an effect of the natural space environment .
Nematode worms showed a significant number of mutations compared to control specimens but no unusual reproductive behavior .
Investigations on animals and plants exhibited the effects of microgravity and radiation on growth patterns , genetic material , bone development , cell differentiation and reproduction , and the effectiveness of antibiotics .
The first documented , successful vertebrate reproduction in space involved mating and hatching Medaka fish eggs .
One fry resulting from in-space fertilization actually hatched and survived , as did prefertilized eggs .
Two newt eggs , laid on orbit , survived , and a high percentage of pre-orbit selected eggs remained viable as embryos and larvae .
In another first occurrence in space , researchers established a gravity threshold , the point where gravity &apos;s effects can be observed , for two organisms--Euglena and jellyfish .
Fruit flies exposed to microgravity exhibited hyperactivity compared to control specimens on Earth , indicating an accelerated aging process in space .
At the request of the governments of Ukraine and the Republic of Georgia , NASA life scientists associated with Space Radar Laboratory-2 received data in October 1994 on Shuttle passes over the two countries .
This data will support technological developments and environmental monitoring in response to concerns of those governments about pollution and disease control .
NASA continued in FY 1994 to make strides in the field of Telemedicine , the practice of medicine across distances using a phone line , satellite , microwave or other telecommunications medium .
The Spacebridge to Moscow Telemedicine Demonstration Project , a flagship program in this arena begun in November 1993 , uses two-way , interactive video between clinical consultants at the Moscow Hospital of the Ministry of Information and four clinical sites in the United States .
Remote aid in diagnosing patients under this project constitutes a successful follow-on to the Spacebridge to Armenia in 1988 .
Regenerative life support research has led to significant advance in the development of new biofilm resistant coatings using application techniques common in industry .
NASA initiated this research to control or prevent the buildup of medically harmful microorganisms in the air , water , and trace-contaminant control systems of long-duration on crewed spacecraft .
Preliminary results ( independently confirmed by the Center for Biofilm Engineering at Montana State University ) show a 50 to 90 + percent reduction in buildup of a common biofilm-forming organism when the coating is applied to plastics or metal .
The coated surface is heat-stable , thus allowing sterilization and reuse .
Of particular note , the coated surface is also extremely easy to clean .
These coatings may have application to preventing biofilm buildup in a number of commercially important areas .
Preliminary estimates by the Center for Biofilm Engineering and the EPA conservatively estimate the commercial potential of these technologies in the hundreds of millions of dollars .
NASA also continued its close cooperation with other Government agencies in research .
A joint biotechnology program between NASA and the NIH emphasized establishing joint centers to accelerate transfer of NASA technology and allow its application to biomedical research , developing advanced tissue-culturing technology for application to biomedical research and developmental biology ; advanced protein crystallization technologies to advance structural biology and drug design to fight diseases ; and technology for early detection of cataracts .
At the end of the fiscal year , NASA had 18 cooperative agreements with 10 institutes of NIH as well as the National Library of Medicine .
Under an interagency agreement between NASA and the NIH , the two agencies established a Center for Three-Dimensional Tissue Culture at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development .
This agreement supports the transfer of NASA &apos;s bioreactor technology to NIH , its further development with NASA support , more protein crystal growth flight experiments , and new investigations of microgravity cell culture .
Additionally , NASA and NIH have selected 22 investigators to fly life science experiments on the Space Shuttle in the period 1994-1996 , the first such NASA / NIH spaceflight experiments ; and 34 investigators for Neurolab , a Spacelab mission to fly on the Shuttle in 1998 , dedicated to brain and behavioral sciences .
NASA has also signed agreements with the National Cancer Institute , the National Library of Medicine , and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development to do research in areas of common interest .
In 1994 NASA received 141 proposals in biotechnology in response to a research announcement .
Peer reviews in FY 1995 will determine which will be pursued further .
NASA and the National Cancer Institute will apply the imaging technology used in HST and elsewhere to the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer .
Three projects in particular offer the promise of developing direct digital mammography systems with high resolution and a wide field of view .
With the National Institute of Mental Health , NASA will help to apply recent advances in computer and information sciences to the brain and related health sciences .
In related endeavors , NASA , the Air Force , and GTE Corporation recently completed a program studying the growth of gallium arsenide in the space environment .
NASA also funds a protein crystal growth program at the Naval Research Laboratory , and under a NASA agreement with the DoD , Walter Reed Army Institute of Research has been conducting cell culture research in a flight system .
A memorandum of understanding between NASA and the NSF has committed those two agencies to collaborative research in environmental signal transduction and cell differentiation in plants in response to environmental stimulation , especially gravity .
Another agreement between NASA and the Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) Association of America will use the technology developed for cooling systems in space suits to develop cool suit technology for victims of MS who have trouble regulating internal body temperature .
A result from a joint project development effort between NASA &apos;s Ames Research Center and the NSF &apos;s Closed Ecological Life Support System Antarctic Analog Project will be NASA &apos;s largest-scale application to date in bioregenerative life support technology and will also feature a recycling system to support Antarctic researchers . Designed to increase the habitability of the Amundsen-Scott South Pole research station and help the United States meet its international obligations to maintain the Antarctic environment in a pristine condition , this project will allow NASA to meet the goal of obtaining long-duration experience in a similar environment to test regenerative life-support candidates for planetary habitats by deploying regenerative food , water , and waste-processing systems for use at the South Pole .
D. Space shuttle
The Space Shuttle &apos;s primary purpose continued in FY 1994 to be transporting people and cargo safely into low-Earth orbit ( 180 to 600 kilometers above the Earth ) .
As of the end of the year , NASA had four active orbiters in its fleet : Columbia , Discovery , Atlantis , and Endeavour .
During FY 1994 Atlantis completed its Orbiter Maintenance Down Period ( OMDP ) in the Orbiter Facility in Palmdale , California .
During OMDP , Atlantis was outfitted with the modifications necessary to dock with the Russian Mir space station , with the first docking mission scheduled for the third quarter of FY 1995 .
As the year ended , the orbiter Columbia was being prepared for delivery to Palmdale for an OMDP .
During the year , NASA initiated a redesign of the external tank for structural weight reduction , which will improving the performance of the Shuttle system .
The redesign involved substitution of aluminum lithium for the existing aluminum alloy , thus taking advantage of the greater strength per unit of weight characteristic of the new material .
The first launch of the resultant super lightweight tank will be in late calendar year 1997 .
The Space Shuttle Main Engine program aggressively pursued the development and implementation of safety and reliability improvements in FY 1994 .
In the current engine , five major components were in the process of being upgraded in two block changes .
Block I incorporates the new phase II + powerhead , the single-coil heat-exchanger , and the alternate high pressure oxidizer turbopump .
Block II contains the Block I improvements and adds the alternate high pressure fuel turbopump and the large throat main combustion chamber .
Engineers conducted 101 ground tests in FY 1994 for a total of 47,775 seconds in support of the development and current flight programs .
To date , the oxidizer turbopump has satisfied its requirements for total development seconds and the first of two formal certification units has successfully completed its 20 test series .
The first Block I certification engine , which contained the second oxidizer turbopump certification unit , began testing in October 1994 .
As of the end of the fiscal year , Block I was scheduled for its first flight in June 1995 .
Engineers involved in the oxidizer turbopump development successfully resolved all of the major technical problems encountered early in development .
Due in large part to this success , Congress approved the resumption of development work on the fuel turbopump , which had been in caretaker status since 1991 .
Development testing of the fuel turbopump was underway at the end of the fiscal year , and the Block II configuration was scheduled to enter service in September 1997 .
The Space Shuttle Main Engine program has also been pursuing performance enhancing changes in engine operation for Block II--part of the overall Shuttle performance enhancement program to support Space Station objectives .
The Solid Rocket Booster successfully supported the eight Shuttle flights begun during FY 1994 .
There was one static test firing of a heavily instrumented flight support motor .
Efforts began to transition Redesigned Solid Rocket Motor nozzle production from Utah to the former Advanced Solid Rocket Motor site in northeast Mississippi .
Elimination of ozone-depleting substances in booster manufacturing continued .
Engineers have been developing two performance enhancements related to the booster as part of the overall Shuttle performance enhancement program to support Space Station objectives .
A motor nozzle exit cone extension will increase the vacuum specific impulse of the motor .
The lightweight booster program will replace the current nylon parachutes with kevlar versions and will include minor structural weight reductions .
In the area of Space Shuttle Systems Integration , the Day-of-Launch I-Load-Update ( DOLILU I ) system was available for all FY 1994 missions .
The system updates the flight trajectory to account for the actual winds on the day of launch .
The DOLILU II system , which will incorporate the main engine control tables , solid rocket trim data , and aerodynamic control data on the day of launch , will further optimize the ascent trajectory of the Shuttle .
NASA expected the first flight using this improvement to occur in May 1995 .
Integration efforts during FY 1994 also included analyses of structural loads ; resolution of in-flight anomalies , waivers , and changes ; and software development and testing for the control of each mission .
To support the international Space Station mission requirements , NASA has initiated efforts to identify , develop , and baseline Shuttle performance enhancements .
Engineers have developed systems integration plans to ensure their orderly implementation into the Space Shuttle program .
Analyses were underway at the end of the year to ensure the compatibility of design modifications to the external tank , main engine , solid rocket boosters , and the orbiter itself .
Engineers have specified design analyses and test requirements to provide definition of flight margins .
All of the enhancements have been specified in support of the first international Space Station assembly flight scheduled for December 1997 .
During 1994 , the Space Shuttle ground processing team at KSC achieved several innovations and enhancements that increased efficiency , improved scheduling , and reduced costs .
A reliability-centered maintenance program continually adjusted procedures based on actual performance data and operational experience .
An integrated work control system , still under development , has already streamlined and automated work control functions related to more than 10,000 major tasks performed in preparing an orbiter &apos;s 22 major systems for flight .
It has prestaged work packages , provided automated notification of needs for parts and material , and thereby reduced the numbers of tasks experiencing holds .
Another improvement in ground processing involves selecting a team leader from a work unit , training him or her , and defining the responsibilities and authority for processing tasks from planning to completion . This enables problems to be resolved at the lowest operational level while providing structure and cohesiveness to the effort .
The task team leader concept has enhanced Shuttle processing , facilitated teamwork , minimized delays , and improved quality .
Over 4,400 NASA and contractor personnel have received training in this concept , which has been employed successfully in all areas of the operation .
E. Satellites Following the loss of Landsat-6 in October 1996 , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) continued to rely on Landsat-5 , in operation since 1984 .
The Landsat series has provided regular observations of the surface of the Earth for two decades , monitoring renewable and nonrenewable resources .
Landsat data applications support programs such as global change research , coastal zone monitoring , timber management , regional planning , and environmental monitoring .
On May 10 , 1994 , the White House announced the Landsat Remote Sensing Strategy , which provides for continuity of existing Landsat and future Landsat-type data .
The strategy assigned Landsat-7 program responsibilities jointly to NASA , NOAA , and USGS .
NASA assumed the satellite-development responsibilities for Landsat-7 from the DoD .
NASA and NOAA will jointly develop the ground system , which NOAA will operate in cooperation with the USGS .
The Earth Resources Observation Systems ( EROS ) Data Center of the USGS will continue to be responsible for maintaining Government archives of Landsat and other land-related remote-sensing data .
Landsat-7 , planned for launch in December 1998 , will carry an improved Enhanced Thematic Mapper ( ETM-Plus ) .
The successful April 13 , 1994 , launch of Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite ( GOES ) -I , renamed GOES-8 once it achieved orbit , resulted in more precise and timely weather observation and provision of data on the atmosphere .
Its design , featuring three-axis stabilization , permits the satellite &apos;s sensors to observe the Earth continuously , compared to only 5 percent of the time for current spin-stabilized satellites .
The first in a series of five advanced weather satellites to be launched over the next several years , GOES-8 was checked out and fine-tuned by NASA for 6 months after launch .
Thus , NOAA did not obtain control over the satellite until after the end of the fiscal year .
NASA , which procures launches and checkouts for the GOES series of satellites and manages their design , development , and launch , planned to launch GOES-J in 1995 to replace GOES-7 , which has already exceeded its expected lifetime .
NOAA is responsible for the operations , including command and control , data receipt , and product generation and distribution for the satellites .
In a totally different area , NOAA announced at the beginning of the calendar year that two new ground stations had been added to the network of satellite search and rescue facilities throughout the United States . Located in Guam and Puerto Rico , they were the final of six new , fully automated installations designed to upgrade the satellite search and rescue system , which helps to bring emergency assistance to mariners , ground-based users , and pilots in distress .
The stations and four others installed in the United States over the preceding year and a half are part of an international satellite search and rescue system known as COSPAS-SARSAT ( from a Russian acronym meaning Space System for Search of Vessels in Distress and an English one for Search and Rescue Satellite-Aided Tracking System ) .
The system enables distress signals from ships or airplanes to be received and processed more quickly than before .
It uses a total of six NOAA environmental satellites and Russian navigational satellites , plus a network of ground stations to pick up radio and beacon signals from the distressed individuals and send them via mission control centers like NOAA &apos;s in Suitland , Maryland , to rescue coordination centers .
Since the inception of the system in 1982 , a total of 4,310 lives had been saved as of September 30 , 1994--960 of them during calendar year 1993 .
The Small Expendable Tether Deployable System-2 ( SEDS-2 ) , conceived and designed by SAO , was a secondary payload on a Delta II rocket launched at 10 : 40 p.m. EST on March 9 , 1994 , from Cape Canaveral AFS , Florida .
At a length of nearly 20 kilometers , it was the longest object ever placed in space .
At 11 : 45 p.m. , the Delta &apos;s second stage ejected the 23-kilogram SEDS-2 , using a spring-loaded device .
The minisatellite reached a final deployed length of 19.8 kilometers in just 1 hour 48 minutes , achieving the primary purpose of the experiment , to suspend such a payload with a minimum of swing .
Thereafter , SEDS-2 remained in space to determine the resistance of its braided polyethelene to micrometeoroids , space debris , and atomic oxygen .
The tether apparently was severed by a micrometeoroid ( or debris ) on March 15 .
Thereafter , the end of the tether reentered the upper atmosphere and burned , while about 10 to 12 kilometers of its length remained attached to the rocket &apos;s second stage and continued orbiting until May 8 , 1994 .
This marked the third SAO-developed tether launched within the past year , each on time and with an increasingly ambitious goal .
F. Space station
Fiscal year 1994 was a time of tremendous accomplishment for the international Space Station program .
In October 1993 , the program formally developed an initial set of specifications , including Russian elements as part of the design .
In December 1993 , the original 12 participating nations in Space Station Freedom ( the United States , Canada , Italy , Belgium , The Netherlands , Denmark , Norway , France , Spain , Germany , United Kingdom , and Japan ) extended an official invitation to Russia to join the partnership , and Russia accepted .
The existing Shuttle / Mir program was then expanded and made Phase I of the international Space Station program .
In February 1994 , the Phase I activity officially began when Sergei Krikalev became the first Russian to fly on the Space Shuttle .
NASA astronauts Bonnie Dunbar and Norm Thagard have been training to fly on the Mir space station since March 1994 at the Russian Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City .
The first American was scheduled to be launched on a Russian spacecraft to Mir in March 1995 .
All of the international Space Station program partners took part in a successful systems design review at Johnson Space Center ( JSC ) , Texas , in March 1994 .
On June 23 , 1994 , NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin and Russian Space Agency ( RSA ) Director General Yuri N. Koptev signed a NASA / RSA interim agreement on Space Station and a $ 400 million contract .
The agreement permits Russian participation in joint program management bodies and the contract covers Russian provision of hardware and data in the program &apos;s early phases ( primarily for Shuttle-Mir activities ) .
Additionally , on August 31 , 1994 , NASA and the Boeing Company signed a memorandum of agreement that defined the content and maximum cost of the prime contract , scheduled for signature by late 1994 .
Also during August , the program completed a vehicle architecture review .
Finally , on September 28 , 1994 , the Space Station Control Board examined the vehicle architecture review and ratified its recommended modifications to the assembly sequence and element requirements for the Space Station .
The redesign of the Space Station that resulted from these activities preserved the best of the previous Space Station Freedom program &apos;s hardware and capability , while adding increased research capability and user flexibility .
The new international Space Station costs $ 5 billion less than Freedom . It has adopted a streamlined management structure and significantly reduced the number of civil service personnel and contractors assigned to the program .
It has adopted an integrated product team approach , using the skills of the civil service workforce to develop a number of Station elements more economically and efficiently , saving millions of dollars in the process .
Furthermore , Russian cooperation has added greater capability to the international Space Station and further reduced United States costs , making the Station an important aspect in the new and evolving relationship between the two countries .
To date , the program has produced 12,000 kilograms of Space Station hardware--about 1,000 kilograms more than projected .
There has been a number of successful technical interchange meetings with the Russians , and Russia has begun delivery of items called for in the contract signed in June .
Before the end of the fiscal year , a NASA liaison team was in place in Moscow , and NASA was working with the Russians to get their liaison office established in Houston .
At a technical interchange meeting in August 1994 , NASA and the RSA agreed on a number of important integration and operations issues , such as how command and control orders would be sent to the Space Station .
Joint management team discussions in Moscow the following month continued and expanded these efforts , resulting in agreement on matters necessary for working together , such as the use of English as the common language .
Meanwhile , the new Canadian government recently reaffirmed support for the international Space Station .
Canada has been restructuring government spending to reduce its debt .
In the face of difficult budget decisions , the Canadian government has continued to recognize its responsibility for developing the Mobile Servicing System , which will provide external Space Station robotics .
Canada also planned to develop the Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator for more delicate robotic operations .
ESA has continued to develop the Columbus Orbital Facility ( COF--a pressurized laboratory ) and laboratory support equipment for early scientific use .
ESA has also been developing the Ariane V launch vehicle and associated transfer vehicles ; as FY 1994 ended , it was involved in discussions with NASA on a possible role for these vehicles in Space Station logistics resupply .
ESA conducted a design-to-cost exercise on the COF , coordinating the technical and management changes closely with NASA .
The Europeans have expressed interest in examining the possibilities for providing a crew rescue vehicle and also an automated transfer vehicle , which would provide propellant resupply and reboost .
Japan has been developing the Japanese Experiment Module ( JEM ) , consisting of a multipurpose pressurized laboratory element , an unpressurized exposed facility , a remote manipulator system , and experiments logistics modules .
Japan &apos;s Space Station program has been making steady progress , with 63 percent of its development funds contracted out .
G. Nuclear energy
To date , the United States has successfully employed 37 Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators ( RTG &apos;s ) on over 20 spacecraft launches .
An RTG is a device without moving parts that converts the heat from the decay of the radioisotope Plutonium-238 ( Pu-238 ) into electricity .
RTG &apos;s have shown the flexibility and ability to operate beyond specified mission lifetimes demanded by a variety of space missions .
For instance , the multi-hundred-watt RTG on the Voyager 2 spacecraft , launched in 1977 , has continued to operate as it has travelled beyond Neptune into space .
The Department of Energy ( DoE ) has developed a new model RTG with a more efficient fuel design called the General Purpose Heat Source ( GPHS ) .
The GPHS-RTG operated successfully on the Galileo and Ulysses missions , launched in 1989 and 1990 , respectively .
DoE program activities in 1994 focused on production of both GPHS components and GPHS-RTG thermoelectric converters to meet the requirements for power of the Cassini mission to Saturn , scheduled for a 1997 launch .
The Savannah River Plant in South Carolina processed the majority of the Pu-238 needed to fuel the three new RTG &apos;s .
In 1994 , Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee completed production of all the iridium parts that will be used to encapsulate the Pu-238 fuel .
Los Alamos National Laboratory , New Mexico , pressed the initial flight pellets of Pu-238 and welded these pellets into the iridium capsules .
The agency will release the preliminary safety analysis report in late 1994 .
The Mound Plant of EG &amp; G Mound Applied Technologies in Miamisburg , Ohio , was proceeding according to plan with RTG assembly preparation activities as the fiscal year ended .
The prime system contractor , Martin Marietta Astrospace , completed the production of all thermo-electric elements for all three RTG &apos;s during the year , and fabrication activities on other portions of the RTG &apos;s remained on schedule .
DoE also developed new conceptual designs for smaller and lighter-weight RTG &apos;s for the Pluto Fast Flyby mission , whose specifications call for it to be powered by RTG &apos;s .
Later in 1994 , DoE will issue a comprehensive report responding to a General Accounting Office inquiry regarding the long-term production capability of RTG &apos;s .
DoE intends to retain its unique capabilities to provide special nuclear power sources for other agencies &apos; needs .
H. Other space technology
During FY 1994 , NASA made significant progress in measuring , modeling , and mitigating the orbital-debris environment .
This completed the third year that the Haystack Orbital Debris Radar , operated for NASA by MIT &apos;s Lincoln Laboratory , has measured and monitored such debris .
This powerful radar can detect debris as small as a pea orbiting 600 kilometers out in space .
At low altitudes ( 400-600 kilometers ) it measured less debris than predicted--good news for the international Space Station .
However , at higher altitudes ( 800-1000 kilometers ) the debris population was greater than NASA had predicted .
Because objects in higher orbits are not significantly affected by changes in solar activity , their lifetimes can exceed 1,000 years , meaning that they will not pose a hazard to the Space Station , but they are a threat to scientific , Earth observation , weather , and communications satellites .
On February 9 , 1994 , the Orbital Debris Radar Calibration Spheres ( ODERACS-1 ) were deployed from Space Shuttle Discovery . The purpose of these six spheres ranging in diameter from 5 to 15 centimeters , is to improve the ability of ground based radars to detect and track small debris objects .
The spheres are expected to remain in orbit providing valuable calibration data until mid-1995 .
NASA also developed a portable telescope that is capable of detecting objects as small as one-half inch in diameter at altitudes ranging from that of the Space Station ( 400-650 kilometers ) through Sun-synchronous altitudes ( 800-1000 kilometers ) and objects as small as 5 to 10 centimeters at geosynchronous altitude ( 36,000 kilometers ) .
This Liquid Metal Mirror Telescope ( LMMT ) concept is based on the research of Dr. E.F. Borra of Laval University in Quebec , Canada , in the area of liquid mercury mirrors .
The prototype 3-meters-diameter LMMT now in operation at NASA &apos;s JSC is the 17th largest telescope in the world . It was built at a cost of about $ 500,000--1 / 100th the cost of comparable Earth-based astronomical telescopes .
To reduce construction costs , NASA designed the LMMT to be housed in a grain silo purchased on the commercial market .
Operational software costs were minimized by modifying software previously developed for JSC &apos;s Charge Coupled Device Debris Telescope .
In a somewhat related effort to forecast space weather and thus to assess the likelihood of damage to satellite components , scientists at Rice University developed sophisticated computer models to calculate the density and energy of particles at any point in space .
They constructed maps similar to those used by meteorologists showing the flow of plasma in the ionosphere and the characteristics of ions and electrons precipitating into the atmosphere .
Using high time resolution , the scientists calculated the way in which the plasma flow changed in response to conditions in the solar wind . They displayed the results graphically as a movie .
More than 50 scientists then carried out coordinated observational campaigns to validate the results of the model .
I. Communications satellites
There were three new commercial domestic fixed satellites launched for the United States during FY 1994 .
Galaxy 1R ( S ) , launched on February 19 , 1994 , will provide video services into the next decade .
The satellite completed systems checkout and in-orbit testing at longitude 89 degrees W. in January 1994 and was then moved to longitude 97 degrees W. to begin providing television and data communications services for United States customers in early February .
Unfortunately , the September 9 , 1994 , launch of Telstar 402 by an Ariane launch vehicle from Kourou , French Guiana , was not as successful .
The launch itself went fine , but operators lost contact with the satellite after it evidently began spinning as it passed over the Indian Ocean .
Customers such as Fox Broadcasting and ABC will continue to use Telstar 401 until Telstar 403 , redesignated Telstar 402R , is launched .
Two other communications satellites that were not in the domestic fixed category but did provide domestic service were the first Direct Broadcast Satellites ( DBS ) .
Launched by an Ariane booster from Kourou , French Guiana , on December 17 , 1993 , DBS-1 , as the satellite is designated by its co-owners , DirecTv and United States Satellite Broadcasting , offered some 75-80 channels of television service after April 1994 to United States subscribers or those purchasing the equipment necessary for reception .
Located at longitude 101 degrees W. , the HS 601 satellite built by Hughes Space and Communications Company provided broadcasting to all of the contiguous 48 states .
It was followed on August 3 , 1994 , by DBS-2 , successfully launched from Cape Canaveral AFS by a Martin Marietta Atlas IIA .
It increased the number of channels available on the service to 150 .
Still another communications satellite placed into orbit during the fiscal year was PanAmSat &apos;s PAS-2--designated PAS-4 by the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) . An Ariane 4 rocket launched it into space from Kourou , French Guiana , on July 8 , 1994 .
The 2,920-kilogram satellite was built by Hughes Aircraft Co. and became PanAmSat &apos;s first private international satellite for the Pacific Ocean Region , providing television coverage from the Western United States to the Asian mainland .
It marks the second of four satellites scheduled to constitute PanAmSat &apos;s Global Satellite System , begun with PAS-1 launched in June 1988 and providing services to the Atlantic Ocean Region .
Also a Hughes HS 601 satellite , PAS-4 can carry more than 320 digital channels transmitted on 16 63-watt Ku-band and 16 34-watt C-band transponders .
The International Telecommunications Satellite Organization ( INTELSAT ) , a consortium established in 1964 and consisting ( in September 1994 ) of 134 member nations that owned and operated the world &apos;s most extensive global communications satellite system with service in more than 200 countries and territories , successfully launched its INTELSAT 701 satellite on October 22 , 1993 , aboard an Ariane 44LP rocket .
The first in its series of high-powered INTELSAT VII spacecraft , INTELSAT 701 began commercial service on January 15 , 1994 , with the transfer of traffic from the INTELSAT 510 satellite launched in March 1985 .
Situated at longitude 174 degrees E. , the Space Systems / Loral satellite began providing expanded telephone , television , and other services to INTELSAT customers in the Pacific Ocean Region , including the west coast of North America , the islands in the Pacific , and the east coast of Asia .
Most long-distance carriers of telephone service in North America and the Asia-Pacific Region began using the new satellite , which handles 90,000 telephone calls at once versus the 75,000 transmitted by the 510 satellite .
In addition , the 701 transmits three television channels at a time instead of the two channels transmitted by INTELSAT 501 .
On June 17 , 1994 , INTELSAT successfully launched the second of nine VII-VII-A satellites ordered from Space Systems / Loral aboard an Ariane 44LP launch vehicle from Kourou , French Guiana .
After moving from its in-orbit test location , INTELSAT 702 began commercial service on August 13 , 1994 , at longitude 359 degrees E. , replacing the lower-capacity INTELSAT 512 .
Serving as the only direct one-hop communications link between the Indian subcontinent and America ( North and South ) , INTELSAT 702 provides expanded communications services to INTELSAT &apos;s customers in Africa , Europe , the Indian sub-continent , the Middle East , the Eastern United States , and South America .
The new satellite is the 50th that INTELSAT has launched ; 22 of these remain in operation providing customers such business services as international video , teleconferencing , facsimile , data , and telex .
The International Maritime Satellite Organization ( Inmarsat ) , a London-based international entity with 75 member countries as the fiscal year ended , did not add to its complement of four INMARSAT II and seven older satellites providing mobile satellite communications in the air , on land and sea for almost 40,000 users of mobile terminals in more than 165 countries .
Among the organization &apos;s accomplishments during the year was the world &apos;s first satellite voice connection to a cellular-sized phone , Inmarsat announced in March 1994 .
The event occurred during trials for a future global handheld phone system to test the power margins needed to provide voice service between 1998 and 2000 .
Meanwhile , in September 1994 , a London department store began selling the INMARSAT-M briefcase satellite telephone .
The lid of the briefcase serves as the antenna for the telephone inside .
Also during the year , the United States Communications Satellite ( Comsat ) Corporation , which holds ( roughly ) a 23-percent share in Inmarsat , opened a new station in Kuantan , Malaysia , on July 1 , 1994 .
This new station plus existing ones in Santa Paula , California , and Southbury , Connecticut , made Comsat the first Inmarsat service provider to operate digital mobile satellite services around the globe .
J. Space network
On November 29 , 1993 , NASA repositioned its first Tracking and Data Relay Satellite ( TDRS-1 ) , launched in 1983 and already serving beyond its 10-year lifetime , to recover scientific data from the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory ( GRO ) , launched in 1991 .
A significant portion of GRO data would otherwise have been lost due to the failure of a tape recorder on the spacecraft .
NASA installed a highly automated ground terminal , GRO Remote Terminal System ( GRTS ) , at its Deep Space Network location in Australia to control TDRS-1 .
This terminal is remotely operated from the TDRS System ( TDRSS ) ground stations in New Mexico .
TDRS-1 started relaying data operationally on December 6 , 1993 , during the shift from its former to its new location , a year from project start .
With TDRS-1 and GRTS , NASA has extended real-time data retrieval to the full orbit for GRO , which is studying the evolution of the universe , the nature of puzzling astronomical objects , and the processes that produce very-high-energy radiation .
NASA has begun making TDRSS available to United States industry to conduct experiments and demonstrations of innovative satellite communications technologies and concepts free of charge .
The intent of this Mobile Satellite Communications via the TDRSS ( MOST ) program is to enhance the competitiveness of the United States industry in the global satellite communications arena .
TDRSS enables testing of lightweight , mobile , handheld satellite communication terminals in a variety of environmental conditions .
Already , the tracking system has been used to demonstrate satellite broadcast of compact disk ( CD ) -quality radio to conduct measurements of path diversity for commercial mobile satellite communications .
Applications of the technologies validated by MOST include , for example : listening to CD-quality radio while driving across the country ; communicating by handheld , wireless devices anywhere in the world , no matter how remote ; and communication by hikers in remote areas during emergencies .
The MOST activity does not interfere with the primary TDRSS mission of relaying commands to and data from scientific spacecraft .
K. Ground networks
NASA uses ground-based telecommunications facilities to provide telemetry , command , and navigation services to a number of NASA , other United States , and international spacecraft such as the Space Shuttle ; other Earth-orbiting spacecraft ; planetary orbiters ; and international spacecraft .
These spacecraft include the Space Shuttle and Earth-orbiters ; planetary orbiters such as Galileo and Magellan ; and the Voyager and Pioneer spacecraft travelling to the outer reaches of our solar system .
Other uses of ground network facilities include tracking and data acquisition services to sounding rocket , high-altitude balloon , and aeronautical research missions .
This worldwide capability has enabled mission operators to navigate their spacecraft , configure them for scientific observations , and recover the resulting scientific data .
During the past year , the recovery of additional image data from the 1993 encounter of the Galileo spacecraft with the asteroid Ida showed the asteroid had a moon .
Magellan , which had been providing scientific data about Venus for several years , concluded its mission in a final experiment as its orbit decreased and it entered the planet &apos;s atmosphere .
In addition , radar image data received from the Clementine spacecraft provided detailed maps of the Moon &apos;s surfaces , and data from the international solar mission , Ulysses , provided unique observations of the southern hemisphere of the Sun .
L. Terrestrial studies and applications
Terrestrial studies themselves encompass a broad range of activities . Among them was NASA &apos;s demonstration during FY 1994 of two new techniques for observing the environment from space .
The first of these was a multifrequency , multipolarization radar--the most complex civilian radar ever flown in space--to study the ecology , water cycles , vegetative cover , as well as oceanography , geology , and volcanology .
In cooperation with Italy and Germany , the Space Radar Laboratory flew on the Space Shuttle Endeavour during April ( SRL-1 ) and September-October 1994 ( SRL-2 ) .
These missions have enabled a team of 52 scientists and ground teams around the world to observe the shifting boundaries between temperate and boreal ( northern ) forests , plus other natural phenomena .
The results will be used for mapmaking , study , and interpretation .
For example , the USGS has begun studying the Sahara in North Africa , the southern part of Africa , Asia , and the Southwestern United States using images from the SRL .
Because radar signals penetrate dry sand and produce images of geologic features otherwise concealed by windblown sand in desert regions , the radar laboratory &apos;s images are being used to map the distribution of various geologic indicators of climate change and of untapped resources , particularly those related to old , dry river systems .
During April and May of 1994 , NASA and the Canadian Government conducted a campaign known as the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study ( BOREAS ) --a large-scale , ground-based and remote-sensing investigation of how the forests and the atmosphere exchange energy , heat , water , carbon dioxide , and other trace gases .
SRL-1 repeatedly imaged BOREAS ground sites , allowing scientists to compare the spaceborne data with their readings from ground and aircraft investigations .
Sample results indicate that water evaporation rates in the boreal ( northern ) forests of central Canada are extremely low .
This data will correct current models that over-predict atmospheric moisture .
In a tangentially related development , in August 1994 NASA , NOAA , and the Canadian Space Agency reached final agreement on the data policy for the Canadian Radarsat spacecraft .
Once launched , Radarsat will map the world , collecting all-weather data of particular value over ice and oceans .
The program plan calls for tilting the satellite to provide a complete mapping of Antarctica as one of the mission objectives .
The second of NASA &apos;s new techniques for environmental observation was lidar--using a laser in a manner similar to radar by bouncing it off objects ( e.g. clouds , pollutants , the Earth &apos;s surface ) and then making environmental measurements from the reflected energy .
The LIDAR In-Space Technology Experiment ( LITE ) flew on the Space Shuttle Discovery in September and observed clouds invisible to conventional weather satellites , dust clouds over Africa , and the structure of a super typhoon in the Pacific , including the top level of clouds and the storm &apos;s eye .
In June 1994 , meanwhile , NASA announced that it had competitively selected two industry-led teams to build , launch , and operate two experimental satellites--each no bigger than a console television set and commonly referred to as &quot; Lewis and Clark &quot; --as part of NASA &apos;s small spacecraft technology demonstration .
The entire contract process lasted only 70 days instead of the standard 6 months to a year .
&quot; Lewis &quot; will be the first-ever space-based &quot; hyper-spectral &quot; imaging system , with wide applications in Earth science and new commercial business opportunities .
&quot; Clark &quot; will help city planners and developers evaluate sites and construction needs through the use of an optical element with very high spatial resolution and capabilities for stereo imaging .
Both spacecraft will carry additional instruments that will provide information on the dynamics of global atmospheric pollution for NASA &apos;s Mission to Planet Earth ( MTPE ) .
MTPE has included education and public awareness as part of its vision to ensure that the public has sufficient information and understanding to support development of prudent policy in the future regarding global environmental change .
Significant efforts are underway at the Federal and agency levels and within MTPE to coordinate and convey program results more effectively .
In this connection , so as to be a catalyst for progress , NASA has begun addressing educational challenges at several levels--training the next generation of Earth scientists who will approach global change from an interdisciplinary perspective , training teachers at the undergraduate level to provide the tools to teach Earth system science , and educating the public at the societal level to build confidence in and understanding of scientific methods .
One of the priorities of the United States Global Change Research Program ( USGCRP ) is to address and contribute to scientific education and communications .
In April 1994 , Vice President Gore announced Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment ( GLOBE ) , a major new initiative to have students from around the world make measurements , submit them to a central source for processing , and analyze the collective findings .
Scientists will be able to use the results in their environmental research .
NOAA and NASA have been leading this effort with contributions from NSF , EPA , the State Department , and other agencies .
The agencies of the USGCRP made significant progress during the year in improving coordination in education and outreach , including development of teacher training materials , provision of fellowships in environmental research , and contributions to new national standards for the teaching of science .
NASA-sponsored analysis of data from Landsat-4 and -5 for 1978 and 1988 showed that deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon Basin was lower than some previous estimates had suggested .
However , the fragmentation of the rain forest and the &quot; edge effects &quot; on the perimeters of these fragments were greater than had been believed , potentially increasing the threat of species extinction .
Tropical forests are home to nearly half of all plant and animal species on Earth .
Researchers concluded that while the area of deforestation had nearly tripled in the 10-year period , the total deforested area was smaller than predicted by many other studies .
Working in close cooperation with researchers from Brazil , the authors of the study validated the use of Landsat data for estimating deforestation in the Amazon , previously an issue of substantial controversy .
Other researchers also demonstrated Landsat &apos;s effectiveness by combining its imagery with GIS technology to identify types and location of landscape elements associated with the risk of Lyme disease in Westchester County , New York .
Also , analysis of data from a combination of Landsat , airborne , and ground-based scanners continued to be used to battle pest damage to California &apos;s $ 10 billion-a-year wine industry .
About 65 percent of Napa and Sonoma counties &apos; vineyards are planted with a grape rootstock vulnerable to a new variety of phylloxera , an aphid-like insect that kills grapevines by sucking juice from their roots .
The spatial and spectral analysis from Landsat &apos;s scanners can detect problems before they become visible to vintners .
Relatedly , USGS &apos; EROS Data Center is the Distributed Active Archive Center ( DAAC ) for data about land processes to be acquired and distributed in support of the Earth Observation System ( EOS ) .
Its functions include storage , management , and distribution of data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer , which will fly on the first EOS platform in 1998 , and from Landsat-7 .
The EROS Data Center was also planning to archive and distribute other data sets through its Land Processes DAAC , including data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer ( AVHRR ) on NOAA &apos;s polar-orbiting satellites , digital aircraft scanner data , digital topography , and associated ancillary data .
The EROS Data Center DAAC component of the EOS Data and Information System ( EOSDIS ) Version 0 became operational in FY 1994 , providing user access to electronic networks , interoperable catalogs , and data distribution capabilities at the EROS Data Center as well as the other DAACs .
The center was in the process of converting historical Landsat data from aging magnetic media to new cassette tapes to preserve them for future use .
It completed conversion of 352,000 Landsat Multispectral Scanner scenes acquired since 1979 , and it also converted about 30 percent of the Landsat Thematic Mapper ( TM ) data in the archive .
The National Geophysical Data Center ( NGDC ) within NOAA had a fully operational center for processing , archiving , and disseminating data from the Defence Meteorological Satellite Program ( DMSP ) .
It became fully operational during the fiscal year , processing data within 48 hours of collection by the Air Force and provided browse images routinely on the Internet .
Also available on Internet , NGDC &apos;s geophysical online data was accessed by an order of magnitude more users than just a year before .
Also , NGDC employees visited more than 30 different classrooms in local schools throughout the year to present workshops on such subjects as earthquakes , volcanoes , and geomagnetism .
Information management is one of the main program elements of NOAA &apos;s Climate and Global Change ( C &amp; GC ) program .
It provides the scientific community with the data and information necessary to evaluate the variability of the global environment , distinguish between natural and human-induced change , and perform integrated assessments of changes in climate and their societal impacts .
Foci of the program include data base development ( rescue , digitization , and assembly of high-priority data sets ) ; data access and archive management , which provide the means to make the data sets available to scientists ; and Pathfinder , which is developing community-consensus algorithms for the reprocessing and dissemination of large-volume , multidecadal , global-scale , operational-satellite data sets .
In FY 1994 , the program supported governmental and academic researchers in 31 projects .
As part of the Landsat Pathfinder program , the USGS has been producing standardized Landsat Multispectral Scanner data sets from three periods ( 1973 , 1986 , and 1992 ) to support the EPA &apos;s North American Landscape Characterization Program .
In FY 1994 , it produced about 400 out of a total of 4,000 scenes for parts of the United States , Mexico , and Central America .
USGS has also been cooperating with NASA plus the Universities of New Hampshire and Maryland to produce similar three-date-time-series Landsat data sets for the Humid Tropical Forest Inventory Project , which is studying the tropical forest regions of the Amazon Basin , Central Africa , and Southeast Asia .
These data sets will serve to monitor changes in land cover over these areas during the 20-year period since the beginning of the Landsat program .
In a separate project using lower-resolution satellite data , since 1992 the USGS has been working with NASA , NOAA , ESA , and more than 31 foreign ground receiving stations to collect AVHRR data ( 1-km resolution ) for each afternoon pass of the NOAA polar-orbiting satellite over the Earth &apos;s land surface .
This Pathfinder project had collected over 93,000 AVHRR scenes by the end of the fiscal year .
They were being used to produce a global land-cover map and to monitor vegetation conditions ( greenness ) on a periodic basis throughout the year .
Routine production of cloud-free composite data for a vegetation index of all global land areas was also underway at the end of the year .
The USGS was cooperating with the EPA , NOAA , and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to prepare a baseline of global , multiscale data on environmental characteristics and to develop mechanisms for identifying , monitoring , and assessing environmental change .
The resulting Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics Monitoring System will be essential for understanding the dynamics of the Earth as a system .
Through a directive from OSTP , an interdisciplinary , interagency Scientific Assessment and Strategy Team formed to provide scientific advice to Federal officials making decisions about recovery and river-basin management following the severe flooding of the Upper Mississippi and Missouri River basins in 1993 .
The team included specialists from USGS , the United States Fish and Wildlife Service , National Biological Survey , Soil Conservation Service , Army Corps of Engineers , EPA , and the Federal Emergency Management Agency .
Working at the EROS Data Center , the team produced numerous maps and analyses , as well as a substantial environmental information system for the two basins using remotely sensed , map , and environmental data .
This includes a wide variety of data made available on Internet .
The team &apos;s preliminary report documents the data and analysis provided to the Interagency Floodplain Management Review Committee , which was providing policy recommendations to the Administration .
In other Department of Interior ( DoI ) activities , the Bureau of Reclamation used remote sensing and GIS &apos;s to aid in the management of water resources .
During FY 1994 , it used aerial photographs and multispectral data from the Landsat TM and SPOT to map irrigated lands , riparian vegetation , and open water at a number of locations in the Western United States .
It used these maps and other spatial data in a GIS with environmental models to estimate consumptive water use .
Airborne video and thermal infrared scanner imagery were used to map river habitat for endangered fish in the Colorado River system , enabling managers to release water from reservoirs in such a way as to maximize survival of the endangered species .
The Bureau of Indian Affairs continued to conduct natural resource inventories , image mapping projects , and GPS training services to support its Indian Integrated Resource Information Program .
Analysts used Landsat TM data to classify land use on several Indian Reservations for forestry and wildlife management applications .
The Bureau continued land cover inventories on reservations in New Mexico and Arizona with emphasis on modeling the potential burn rate of different vegetation types in response to fires .
Landsat TM and SPOT panchromatic data enabled the Bureau to prepare image maps for three reservations , while GPS training supported resource inventory programs .
The Bureau of Land Management used remotely sensed data and GPS to monitor the health of public lands and the effectiveness of ecosystem-based management practices .
Landsat , SPOT , and AVHRR satellite data plus aerial photographs supported ecosystem-based management of mineral resources ; land-use planning ; fire fuels mapping ; characterization of wildlife habitat ; and delineation of hazardous materials and their impacts at a number of sites on public lands throughout the United States .
GIS and GPS technology supported much of this analysis .
The National Biological Survey , now one year old , has continued a wide variety of remote sensing projects transferred from other DoI bureaus .
The Gap Analysis Program , a statewide and national program to identify land areas not being protected and managed to maintain biological diversity , was one such program transferred from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service .
The program is based on mapping of actual natural vegetation from Landsat TM and other data using a nationwide classification system for vegetation .
Standardized mapping methods and data formats permit aggregation of State-level data for comparison at regional and national levels .
At the end of the year , projects were underway in 36 States with data from Nevada and Washington nearing completion .
With adequate funding , complete national-level data sets will be available by 1999 .
The National Park Service initiated a comprehensive , multi-year program in FY 1994 to map vegetation in 235 units of the National Park System , excluding Alaska .
The program will provide consistent baseline digital data about the composition and distribution of vegetation to support the National Park Service Inventory and Monitoring program .
Mapping will be done through interpretation of medium-scale ( 1 : 20,000 ) natural color and color-infrared aerial photographs using a nationwide standardized classification system .
The National Biological Survey is working closely with the Park Service to plan and direct the project , beginning with pilot studies in a variety of selected park environments .
With transfer of research activities to the National Biological Survey in FY 1994 , the United States Fish and Wildlife Service began emphasizing use of computerized mapping , aerial photographs , and Landsat and SPOT data for day-to-day operations , especially managing wildlife habitat from an ecosystem perspective .
It has used remotely sensed data and GIS technology to evaluate the effects of habitat changes on migratory birds , assess threats of environmental contaminants to biological resources like endangered species , and identify the most valuable lands for inclusion in new refuges like Canaan Valley , West Virginia .
The Service also led a Federal Geographic Data Committee effort to develop national standards for mapping wetlands and was active in a similar attempt to define a standard for mapping upland vegetation .
These activities will reduce costs for acquiring remotely sensed data and increase the consistency of the resultant maps of these resources .
The United States Bureau of Mines has directed its remote sensing research to the development of applications to abandoned mine land areas .
This innovative technology will address the identification and characterization of mineralogy of waste materials and associated potential for development of acid mine drainage and occurrence of heavy metals at these sites .
The applications utilize Landsat TM satellite images and airborne multispectral scanner data and were field tested in the Cripple Creek Mining District in central Colorado .
The successful completion of this research will provide a quick procedure for inventorying and initial characterization of noncoal mine waste materials , providing land management agencies with an increased ability to focus on the remediation of these sites .
Within the United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) , the remote sensing program of the Foreign Agricultural Service ( FAS ) continued to be a critical element in the analysis of domestic and foreign agricultural production , supply , and demand--providing timely , accurate , and unbiased estimates of global area , yield , and production .
The agency used satellite imagery , crop models , and remotely sensed weather data to support State Department assessments of food needs in the States of the former Soviet Union , particularly the drought-affected Ukraine .
The FAS also prepared detailed analyses of the performance of India &apos;s summer monsoon , frost damage to Brazil &apos;s coffee crop , and drought in Australia &apos;s eastern wheat regions .
Satellite-derived early warning of unusual crop conditions allowed for price adjustments in commodity markets and helped maximize United States farmers &apos; returns .
In addition , the FAS used satellite imagery to monitor domestic crop production areas in support of work carried out by the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service ( redesignated the Farm Service Agency in October 1994 ) .
The National Agricultural Statistics Service ( NASS ) used remote sensing data in constructing area frame samples ( using data from small sample areas as an aid to estimating crops and acreages ) , crop-specific land cover mapping , direct estimation of planted crop area , and assessment of crop conditions .
Products from the first three areas were mainly based on Landsat-5 TM and SPOT MultiSpectral Scanner data .
Crop condition assessment used data from the NOAA-11 satellite .
In 1994 , NASS completed a California area frame for conducting 1994 surveys , New York and South Carolina frames for survey use in 1995 , and it initiated work on a KS frame .
Among a host of other activities , NASS improved biweekly vegetative index map products for the 1994 crop season , based on NOAA-11 AVHRR data , and distributed them to NASS offices and USDA policy makers for their use .
Starting in the fall of 1993 , NASS entered into a cooperative agreement with the Intertribal Agricultural Council to collect pilot-level data on Native American farm operator production .
One result of the agreement was a crop-specific land-cover map of the Crow and Northern Cheyenne Reservations in Montana , delivered in September 1994 .
Another satellite data application was the Delta Remote Sensing Project in Arizona .
It regressed multitemporal , computer-classified Landsat TM data against ground information to provide estimates with reduced sampling error for rice , cotton , and soybean acreage .
The resulting data provided county acreage estimates for the 1993 season in tabular form and in colored theme-map and tabular form .
NASS continued to produce biweekly vegetative index map products based on NOAA-11 AVHRR data during the 1994 crop season .
It distributed the maps to USDA decisionmakers and to various NASS state statistical offices to aid in assessments of crop conditions .
In 1994 , NASS improved the maps in several ways , such as adding the capability to compare the current value with a meridian of several previous years .
However , due to the aging NOAA-11 satellite , on which one AVHRR ceased to function in September , and a relatively unstressed crop year , the 1994 maps contained less information than those of 1993 when the Midwest flood and the Southeast drought were featured in the maps .
The Agricultural Research Service ( ARS ) used remote sensing and GIS technologies to provide information about the extent and spatial dynamics of leafy spurge , a troublesome weed , in the Theodore Roosevelt National Park , ND , among many other applications .
The results contributed to the development of a management plan for leafy spurge in the park and provided insight into the application of integrated spatial technologies for natural resource management .
Other uses of remote imaging together with data from the ground included maps of soil salinity , biomass , crop management , and crop yields .
For example , a cooperative program was undertaken examining commercial cotton fields in the San Joaquin Valley of California , aimed at developing integrated tools to produce crops that maximize economic return , support efficient use of natural resources , and minimize detrimental impacts on the environment .
ARS researchers also developed fluorescence techniques and a prototype fluorescent instrument to discriminate and quantify crop residues .
The effective management of these remains from the harvest minimizes soil erosion and improves water quality .
In the area of hydrology , ARS scientists , in close cooperation with NASA and the Department of Commerce ( DoC ) , used ground-based and remotely sensed data to aid in understanding how conditions in river basins influence climate and climate change .
ARS also is using space signals to help develop &quot; precision farming systems &quot; that permit land managers to adjust the treatment ( with fertilizers , pesticides , or seeding rates ) continuously across a field based on detailed local knowledge .
In 1994 , the Forest Service ( FS ) used remote-sensing and associated technologies to assist in fighting fires throughout the Western United States as well as to detect high-risk fire zones , assess damage , monitor national and foreign ecosystems , and administer / manage more than 191 million acres of National Forest System lands and works .
The number of wildfires reached a record high in 1994 , with more than 66,000 fires and over 3.8 million acres burned .
To combat these blazes , the FS employed airborne scanners , including Firefly developed by JPL , to help map and determine both speed and direction of the fires .
Throughout the year , the FS used such remote sensing technology as AVHRR imagery from NOAA satellites to implement early-warning measures .
Once fires started , the FS shifted to greater use of imagery from aircraft .
When fires had been suppressed , the FS employed satellite imagery to map and assess changes in the landscape caused by the fires .
Other uses for remote sensing included mapping , vegetation classification , the rehabilitation and restoration of ecosystems , research for global greenhouse gas emissions , land management , identification of critical wildlife habitat , support of law enforcement , and inventory programs .
The FS initiated partnerships with international , Federal , State , and private organizations for ecosystem assessment , leading to greater use of satellite data and increased understanding of global ecological processes .
For example , technical exchanges continued with Russia , Brazil , Indonesia , Mexico , Canada , Australia , and Kenya among other countries .
FS research and development of airborne video , digital cameras , radar , and GPS systems continued to address numerous ecosystem management applications .
Integration of remotely sensed data into GIS &apos;s proved to be cost effective in supporting land management decisions .
The Soil Conservation Service ( redesignated the Natural Resources Conservation Service or NRCS in October 1994 ) adopted digital orthophotography as the common framework for collecting and managing natural resource geospatial databases .
The Service cooperated with other Federal and State agencies to acquire aerial photography and digital orthophotography .
In addition , it and other USDA agencies agreed with the DoD to purchase GPS units to collect georeferences for natural resource data to be included in a GIS .
The United States Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) , primarily through its Environmental Monitoring Systems Laboratory in Las Vegas , Nevada ( EMSL-LV ) , with assistance from its Atmospheric Research and Exposure Assessment Laboratory in Research Triangle Park , NC , also routinely conducted research and provided technical support using remote sensing as part of its overall environmental monitoring program .
The Agency used large-scale aerial photography to develop site characterization data during the remedial actions under the Comprehensive Environmental Response , Compensation , and Liability Act ( CERCLA ) , as well as to support site selection and monitoring at hazardous waste facilities operated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ( RCRA ) .
It developed and used remote-sensing systems to support the provisions of the Clean Water Act .
In FY 1994 , the EMSL-LV completed approximately 150 aerial-photographic site-characterization projects under CERCLA and RCRA , and satellite imagery played a part in helping engineers develop detailed site characterizations .
Aerial photography and satellite data also supported a broad variety of pollution , global change , pollution prevention , compliance , and other ecosystem monitoring studies in FY 1994 , such as those of critical-habitat areas for wildlife .
In support of activities associated with the identification of the impacts and hazards resulting from severe flooding along the Mississippi River and its tributaries in FY 1993 , the EPA &apos;s Environmental Photographic Interpretation Center ( EPIC--a branch of EMSL-LV ) analyzed aerial photographs acquired , in cooperation with the Army Corps of Engineers , to identify flood impacts on industrial and agricultural facilities for assessment of hazardous and toxic waste movement and containment .
Additional analysis of pre- and postflood aerial photographs by EPIC in FY 1994 identified and mapped changes that have occurred at known waste disposal sites affected by the flooding .
M. Atmospheric studies NASA &apos;s and NOAA &apos;s efforts to monitor ozone depletion continued to reflect the effects of the Mount Pinatubo eruption in June 1991 .
Data from NASA instruments such as the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer aboard the Russian Meteor-3 satellite ( launched in 1991 ) as well as NOAA instruments aboard balloons and the NOAA-9 satellite have enabled scientists to study the global cooling effects and loss of ozone that resulted from the eruption .
These are the first unambiguous , direct measurements of large-scale changes in the Earth &apos;s radiation budget caused by a volcanic eruption .
Ozone , a molecule made up of three atoms of oxygen , forms a thin layer of the atmosphere that absorbs harmful ultraviolet radiation from the Sun .
The term &quot; ozone hole &quot; describes a large area of intense ozone depletion that occurs over Antarctica during late August through early October and typically breaks up in late November .
Scientists have determined that chlorine products from human activities , such as electronics manufacturing , air conditioning , and refrigeration , are a primary cause of ozone hole formation .
The Antarctic ozone levels for 1994 were nearly as small as the record lows from October 1993 .
The slight recovery in 1994 probably resulted from fewer sulfuric acid particles remaining from the eruption of Mount Pinatubo .
The NSF &apos;s Office of Polar Programs continued during the year to support researchers studying the cause and effects of the Antarctic ozone hole at each of three year-round stations .
Both balloons for in situ measurements and remote sensing instruments were used .
There was a particularly strong effort during the late austral winter and early spring of 1994 to support the NASA-sponsored ER-2 aircraft flights from Christchurch , New Zealand , to study the ozone levels .
The Microwave Limb Sounder ( MLS ) on the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite ( UARS--launched in 1991 ) continued , meanwhile , to make unprecedented measurements of global chlorine monoxide ( ClO ) concentration , observing the spatial relationships of ClO , ozone , temperature and other atmospheric variables .
These measurements provide the first global picture of the reactive form of chlorine that destroys ozone .
Even though regulations will phase out the production of chlorofluorocarbons in the future , the removal of chlorine from the stratosphere is a very slow process ( taking decades or centuries ) , and stratospheric chlorine will continue to increase for at least the next few years , as chlorine already released into the lower atmosphere reaches the stratosphere .
The MLS is providing the only global monitoring of this process during the critical period in which stratospheric chlorine is increasing to record levels .
A major focus of the Upper Atmosphere Research Program ( UARP ) in 1994 was the Airborne Southern Hemisphere Ozone Experiment / Measurements for Assessing the Effect of Stratospheric Aircraft campaign .
The goal of this effort in the Pacific was to obtain in-situ measurements of atmospheric trace gases related to stratospheric ozone .
Full analysis of the data combined with model calculations will improve our understanding of the chemistry and processes of midlatitudes .
Scientists from NASA and NOAA contributed to the recently completed &quot; Assessment of Ozone Depletion : 1994 , &quot; developed under the auspices of the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme .
This periodically issued report provides the scientific basis for policy decisions by parties to the Montreal Protocol ( the international agreement limiting the use and production of chlorofluorocarbons ) and its amendments .
NASA &apos;s ozone measurements are part of the Agency &apos;s MTPE program , which includes measurements from instruments on free-flying spacecraft and the Space Shuttle ; aircraft , in situ , and ground-based observations ; a comprehensive data and information system to process and distribute the findings ; and a modeling effort designed to help understand , and eventually predict , the behavior of and changes in the Earth &apos;s system as well as to distinguish the effects of natural and human-induced global climatic change .
The first phase of MTPE includes the flight by NASA and partners of more than two dozen missions through 1998 .
Data from MTPE and other global change research efforts will enable policymakers to formulate prudent policies regarding the future of the global environment .
The second phase of MTPE is the EOS program , a series of spacecraft planned to carry a variety of sophisticated instruments to make the most comprehensive measurements ever of the interrelated elements of the global environment .
NASA &apos;s program is part of the international Earth Observing System , in which satellites and instruments from the United States , Europe , Japan , and Canada are being closely coordinated to provide complementary data on different aspects of the Earth &apos;s environment .
In support of NOAA &apos;s GOES program , NASA participated in the successful launch of the GOES-8 satellite in April 1994 .
GOES-8 and subsequent GOES satellites ( J-M ) are the prime observational platforms for dynamic weather and the near-Earth environment for the 1990s and beyond .
In mid-1994 , the EOS program was redesigned to respond to a reduction in program budget through the year 2000 .
NASA &apos;s objectives were to preserve the scientific integrity of EOS as a global change program and to maintain the target launch schedule for core EOS missions .
Realigning the EOS program meant placing greater reliance on both domestic and foreign partners , in addition to deferring some data products and measurements .
However , some high-priority scientific items were added to the program or scheduled sooner , such as flight of an additional Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment ( SAGE ) instrument in the year 2000 and the incorporation of a Landsat-type instrument on the EOS AM-2 spacecraft ( AM indicating a morning crossing time over the equator ) .
In September , NASA released a major solicitation seeking proposals for a &quot; common &quot; spacecraft bus for several of the subsequent EOS flights with selection expected in 1995 .
Meanwhile , development continued on the EOSDIS , the means by which information from MTPE observations and analysis will be archived and made available to researchers and other worldwide users ; NASA modified its planning for EOSDIS architecture , making it more extensible and accessible .
In August 1994 , NASA released Version O , a working prototype for EOSDIS , designed for the general Earth science community for use in scientific research .
Pathfinders constitute a recent application of Earth-science and other data sets , developed specifically to study global environmental change .
They focus on processing , reprocessing , archiving , maintaining , and distributing existing data sets to make them more useful to researchers .
In FY 1994 , the focus of the joint NASA-NOAA Pathfinder was on generating data for the benchmark period April 1987 to November 1988 , but additional data sets included TOPEX / Poseidon , an educational CD-ROM , the First International Satellite Cloud Climatology Regional experiment , and the UARS .
Using Pathfinder data sets , NASA scientists combined NOAA-7 , -9 , and -11 data on vegetation dating back to 1981 to predict the likelihood of famine and locust plagues in Africa , for use by the United States Agency for International Development to locate drought areas and locust swarms .
NASA also solicited broadened application of its scientific and technological assets via Internet .
A significant number of the resultant proposals and awards involved using the Internet to make environmental information more readily available for educational purposes .
The NSF also studied global change .
Under the Coupling , Energetics , and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions ( CEDAR ) program , scientists at the University of Tennessee , Urbana , organized a campaign referred to as ALOHA-93 ( Airborne Lidar and Observations of the Hawaiian Airglow ) .
Involving experimenters from several academic and commercial research institutions , its purpose was to study the source and dynamics of gravity waves over the mid-Pacific in October 1993 .
Gravity waves are a major source of energy and momentum coupling between different layers of the atmosphere from the troposphere to the lower thermosphere .
In ALOHA-93 , a sodium lidar , optical imager , and spectrometer gathered data from an aircraft , the flights being coordinated with selective overpasses of NASA &apos;s UARS ( launched in 1991 ) .
The campaign obtained important information on midocean storms and generation , propagation , and filtering of gravity waves in the mesosphere and stratosphere . This should lead to better parameterization of gravity waves in global circulation models .
The airborne observations also revealed rich horizontal structure in sporadic sodium layers observed in conjunction with substantial increases in mesopause temperature .
These metal layers , formed through meteoric ablation , appear to be sensitive to global atmospheric changes related to changing levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide and methane .
Also , the CEDAR program sponsored a special competition to encourage the development of innovative technical approaches , resulting in a number of projects to improve instrumentation and techniques .
The NSF has supported studies of how variations in the energy output from the Sun and anthropogenic effects contribute variously to global change .
The SunRISE ( Radiative Inputs of the Sun to Earth ) program supports the development and deployment of a precision photometric telescope designed for measurements of sunspots , faculae , and other features thought to be sources of variations in solar brightness .
The program also supports measurements of the solar diameter and analysis of the historical measurements of the plage phenomena ( bright , granular areas in the chromosphere of the Sun ) , which are possible indicators of changes in radiance .
A second area of emphasis in the last year has been space weather , conditions on the Sun and in the solar wind , magnetosphere , ionosphere , and thermosphere that can significantly influence the performance and integrity of important space-borne and ground-based technological systems .
The NSF supported a study conducted by scientists at Johns Hopkins University in which they used data from a Swedish satellite to predict electrical currents induced in a power grid at Chalk Point , MD ; they successfully correlated intense electrical currents in the ionosphere with the induced currents on the ground .
Other studies of ionospheric currents used magnetometer arrays deployed by scientists from Boston College , Augsburg College , and the University of Michigan .
The scientists will use data from these newly created arrays in Canada and Greenland to study dynamic variations in ionospheric currents that originate from the entry of energetic particles from the Sun into Earth &apos;s atmosphere .
Another atmospheric and environmental concern in recent years has been global warming .
In the first international , interdisciplinary effort to discuss this issue broadly , 37 scientists from 10 countries met near the beginning of the fiscal year at a conference sponsored by DoE and NOAA .
Among the findings of the conference were that while the global average temperature has been rising in recent decades , the warming has not been truly global and has occurred mainly at night .
Scientists believe that the cause of higher nighttime temperatures may be the combined result of an increase in greenhouse gases and cloud cover over continents combined with increased sulfur emissions produced by the burning of fossil fuels .
A climatic model developed by James Hansen of NASA that took all three factors into account came closer to simulating observed temperature changes than had previous models .
While nighttime warming may lengthen the growing season and reduce killing frosts , it might increase insect infestations , reduce crop-growing areas , and raise heat-related death rates among humans .
In a study relevant to this issue , NIST has been studying isotropic measurements for NASA to identify and quantify the presence of tropospheric methane ( CH4 ) , which is second only to carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) in its effects on global warming .
Although the tropospheric CH4 concentration is a small fraction ( 5 percent ) of that of CO2 , CH4 accounts for about 12 percent of the global temperature rise , due to strong absorption in a relatively transparent part of the infrared .
Intensive CH4 measurement and modeling is underway because of significant uncertainties in both anthropogenic and natural emission data that are critical for estimating the global CH4 budget .
To serve these needs , NIST has compiled a data base of global source and ambient isotropic measurements .
N. Oceanographic studies
TOPEX / Poseidon , a satellite jointly sponsored by the French Space Agency , Centre National d &apos;Etudes Spatiales ( CNES ) , and NASA ( launched in August 1992 ) continued to provide valuable information during 1994 .
The satellite uses a radar altimeter to yield precise measurements of sea-surface height .
Data analysis shows the seasonal change in sea level in the Northern Hemisphere is about 50 percent larger than in the southern half of the globe .
This was a previously unknown asymmetry and indicates the air-sea heat exchange is much stronger in the Northern Hemisphere .
Data from the satellite have also enabled scientists to track disturbances caused by the lingering effects of the El Ni√±o event of 1991-93 , the longest one in the last 40 years .
El Ni√±o is a warm inshore current annually flowing south along the coast of Ecuador around the end of December and extending about every 7 to 10 years down the coast of Peru ; it can bring devastating weather to several global regions , including heavy rains and flooding as well as colder than normal winters across the United States , and severe droughts and dust storms in Australia .
Observations made by TOPEX / Poseidon in the North Pacific revealed a northward shift of the Kuroshio , the swift current southeast of Japan , which has been traced back to the El Ni√±o event of 1982-83 .
Meteorologists believe that the position of the Kuroshio is drastically affecting the weather of North America .
NASA , CNES , and NOAA held discussions in 1994 on a TOPEX / Poseidon Follow-On ( TPFO ) mission , in which NOAA , the new partner , would provide the ground segment .
TPFO would meet both operational and research needs .
NASA also participated in the international Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere ( TOGA ) -Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment ( COARE ) program .
Measurements from NASA &apos;s ER-2 and DC-8 aircraft have produced significant improvements in our understanding of precipitation , convection , clouds and radiation , air-sea interaction and oceanographic processes .
Results from the 1993 TOGA-COARE field exercise in oceanography and long-term atmospheric effects will be presented in Melbourne , Australia , in April 1995 .
Meanwhile , the NIST Radiometric Physics Division has been continuing its collaboration with the NASA Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor ( SeaWiFS ) project and associated investigators .
SeaWiFS , scheduled for launch in 1995 , is designed to provide global observations of photosynthetic pigment concentrations contained in the microscopic marine plants called phytoplankton .
Among other things , these measurements will help to assess how much carbon dioxide transferred to the ocean from the atmosphere is being transformed into oceanic plant biomass .
Accurate calibration of the SeaWiFS instrument is critical to the mission &apos;s success .
Also , sea-based optical measurements for validation of the post-launch calibration and various products derived from the satellite observations must be equally accurate .
NIST &apos;s role is to help ensure that these observations are traceable to radiometric standards and that instrument calibrations are performed properly .
NIST has designed , constructed , and characterized a portable , multichannel spectroradiometer ( SeaWiFS Transfer Radiometer or SXR ) to compare the calibrations of field instruments and to check the calibration sources at different institutions .
The device was used during the second and third SeaWiFS Round Robins in June 1993 and September 1994 .
NIST also used the device during a NASA / NOAA field experiment in February 1994 at the Marine Optical Buoy ( MOBY ) support facility in Hawaii .
MOBY will be used to verify the postlaunch SeaWiFS calibration and other future ocean color satellite instruments to be launched later in this decade under the EOS program .
Near the end of the fiscal year , NOAA announced completion of initial flight tests of a new system for mapping coastal ocean salinity .
Called the scanning low-frequency microwave radiometer , the new system is smaller than older ones and can be operated from small , single-engine aircraft rather than the four-engine C-130 .
Consisting of a microwave radiometer , an infrared radiometer , a GPS instrument for locating measurements , and a computer , the new system can produce salinity maps at the rate of 100 square kilometers per hour .
NOAA &apos;s National Environmental Satellite , Data , and Information Service ( NESDIS ) anticipated collaborating with other NOAA and Federal agencies and academia in coastal-ecosystem health , hydrological , and coastal forecasting activities where data on salinity are critical , such as in studies of the distribution of brown shrimp in the Mississippi Delta and Gulf of Mexico .
Additionally , NOAA / NESDIS &apos;s Office of Satellite Data Products and Distribution forged a partnership with NASA for the development and joint funding of a United States ground system to support real-time collection of high-priority scatterometer and ocean color data from the Japanese Advanced Earth Observing Satellite , scheduled for launch in 1996 .

1 . Canadian Space Programme
The Canadian Space Agency ( CSA ) and other Canadian government departments and agencies involved in space are continuing efforts to implement the new Canadian Space Programme ( CSP ) announced in 1994 .
In all sectors , work in progress to define and implement programmes in priority areas for Canada in the fields of human space flight , Earth observation , satellite communications , space science and space technology development .
Activities undertaken by Canada in those areas guarantee a Canadian contribution to the global knowledge base and help to achieve socio-economic benefits for all Canadians .
In order to better accomplish those ends , the President of CSA has recently begun a process of reorganizing the Agency .
The reorganization process has involved extensive consultation with the employees of CSA and all the major Canadian stakeholders in space activities .
The objectives of the reorganization are to produce an organizational structure that better fulfils the mandate of CSA , makes better use of the skills of its employees , responds more effectively to a changing environment , and plans better for the future .
The major orientations and objectives of CSP remain as follows :
( a ) To focus on the commercial and technological strengths of Canada to meet its ongoing needs in space science , automation and robotics , Earth observation and communications ;
( b ) To promote economic growth and employment ;
( c ) To enhance Canadian industrial competitiveness and export capability ;
( d ) To foster the advancement of knowledge .
Like all federal government programmes , CSP underwent budgetary reductions in early 1995 .
Funding for the Second Long-term Space Plan for the period from 1994 / 95 to 2003 / 04 , approved in June 1994 , was reduced by 15 per cent in the budget provisions of February 1995 .
The guiding principles to be observed in carrying out the reductions in Canadian space activities are fivefold : first , that space remains a key priority of the Government of Canada , despite the reductions ; second , that the reductions are to be achieved while preserving the funding balance between the major components of CSP identified in June 1994 ; third , that Canada will meet its commitments to its international partners on the International Space Station Alpha ; and fourth , that the timetable for implementing the Second Long-term Space Plan will not be significantly affected .
( a ) Some Canadian accomplishments in space in 1995
The most significant event of 1995 was the launch of RADARSAT-I , the first Canadian Earth observation satellite , on 4 November 1995 .
RADARSAT-I will use synthetic aperture radar ( SAR ) to observe the Earth , even in darkness and through clouds , providing data essential to a variety of applications for resource management and environmental monitoring .
Work will soon start on the follow-up satellite , RADARSAT-II , which will be ready for launch around the year 2000 .
Canadian astronaut C. Hadfield took part in the Shuttle Mission STS-74 that docked with the MIR station of the Russian Federation , and operated the Canadarm system used to put into place the docking adaptor that will allow repeated shuttle missions to MIR .
C. Hadfield was the first Canadian to orbit in a spacecraft of the Russian Federation and the first Canadian mission specialist .
In the area of space science and research into global change , Canada is continuing to develop the instrument called Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere , its contribution to the Earth Observing System of the United States of America , destined for launch on a polar platform in 1998 .
This mission , developed in collaboration with scientists of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States , will measure the amount of carbon monoxide and methane in the Earth atmosphere in order to determine the effects of human activity on the atmospheric environment of the planet .
CSA , in collaboration with the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) and the Centre national d &apos;√©tudes spatiales ( CNES ) ( the French National Centre for Space Studies ) , has recently made important discoveries with the Wind Imaging Interferometer ( WINDII ) .
Data from this instrument show planetary scale disturbances in upper atmospheric weather corresponding to one or two waves around the globe .
These disturbances resemble weather patterns , but clearly demonstrate that the upper atmosphere responds to processes arising at the surface of the Earth .
WINDII also discovered a gap in atomic oxygen at the equator , thought to be due to the action of atmospheric tides and associated winds .
Canadian scientists participated with scientists from France , Germany , Japan , the European Space Agency ( ESA ) and NASA in the second International Microgravity Laboratory mission launched in July 1995 .
Approximately 80 studies were conducted on the effects produced by microgravity on astronauts , including back pain and changes in nerve conduction and in the cardiovascular system .
Canada recently became a partner in a multinational cooperative endeavour to support research into semiconductor and oxide materials using the floating zone process .
The Commercial Float Zone Furnace will fly on the SPACELAB 04 mission to process 12 sample materials being investigated by researchers from Canada , Germany and the United States .
Also important is the ongoing COSPAS-SARSAT programme ( the International Satellite System for Search and Rescue ) , of which Canada is one of the four original member States along with France , Russian Federation and the United States .
The System currently features 6 satellites , 28 ground stations and 15 control centres in 16 countries .
To date it has saved 4,535 lives .
Canada is continuing work on the development of the Mobile Servicing System ( MSS ) , its contribution to the largest international science project in history , the International Space Station Alpha .
( b ) Key events in the Canadian Space Programme in 1996
This project is a cooperative venture involving Canadian and United States partners in the private sector , and will provide voice , data transmission and paging services to users .
Also important in 1996 will be the activities of three Canadian astronauts .
D. Williams was selected by NASA as part of the 1994 class of mission specialist trainees .
Dr. B. Thirsk was also selected as a payload specialist for space shuttle flight STS-78 , following a rigorous international selection process involving astronauts from several countries .
STS-78 will be a Life and Microgravity Sciences Space Lab Mission .
To complete the group , M. Garneau , the first Canadian astronaut in space , was selected for a second space shuttle mission .
M. Garneau will fly as a mission specialist aboard Endeavour flight STS-77 , on a nine-day mission scheduled for April 1996 .
Finally , work is in progress on the definition of two small scientific missions , as well as on the collaboration between Government and industry in the Advanced SatCom and the International Mobile Research programmes .
2 . Space activities that were or could be the subject of greater cooperation ,
with particular emphasis on the needs of developing countries
In June 1994 , the Government of Canada approved the new CSP , which calls for investments of 2.4 billion Canadian dollars over 10 years , and is the result of over two years of intensive consultations between CSA and all stakeholders in Canada .
The new CSP calls for investments in several sectors , in particular the following :
( a ) Earth observation ( completion of RADARSAT I , initiation of RADARSAT II , advanced radar technology development , ground segment upgrades , applications development and technology transfer ) ;
( b ) Satellite communications ( launch of MSAT , a programme for advanced satellite communications development , a programme for development of technologies for mobile communications ) ;
( c ) Space science ( activities in solar-terrestrial physics , atmospheric sciences , astronomy and microgravity life and materials sciences , a space science enhancement programme and the possibility of two small satellites for science missions ) ;
( d ) Space technology ( ongoing in-house projects and contracting out development , a new strategic space technology development programme , and contributions to new ESA programmes ) ;
( e ) Flights for Canadian astronauts ( opportunities on the United States space shuttle and preparation of related experiments ) ;
( f ) A new space awareness programme to encourage Canadian youth to undertake careers in science and technology .
Also in June 1994 , the Government announced that , following the successful conclusion of discussions with NASA , Canada would remain a full partner in the context of the International Space Station project , albeit at a reduced cost .
The new CSP also mentions that space activities are of strategic importance to the transition of Canada to a knowledge-based economy , and identifies CSA as the lead coordinator for all policies and programmes of the Government in civil space-related research , science and technology , industrial development and international cooperation .
Cooperation is essential to the implementation of CSP , as it promotes the sharing of costs and risk in carrying out programmes and activities .
The time for cooperation has never been so good , with the new opportunities resulting from such major events as the end of the cold war and the increased realization around the globe of the important uses of space technologies , systems and science for sustainable development .
Clearly , issues affecting the common welfare call for common solutions , and international space cooperation therefore becomes a chosen instrument .
In that context , and also because most Canadian space activities have always been undertaken in collaboration with foreign partners , it is expected that significant opportunities for enhanced international cooperation will arise in the future , especially in the context of the new CSP .
The possibilities for cooperation are expected to be found in most of the sectors identified above in the description of the new CSP , and more specifically in space science research ( including microgravity research ) , space technology development , radar technology and systems development and applications of RADARSAT data and of communications satellites .
Several of the opportunities for cooperation could be very helpful in furthering the process of sustainable development , where possible .
In particular , Canada ( mainly through the efforts of the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing and the Canadian International Development Agency ) has been working closely with developing countries in all regions in addressing the potential uses of RADARSAT data for a variety of applications , such as geology and geomorphology , the identification and monitoring of primary forest clearing for agricultural land use , ice monitoring , the monitoring of changes in shorelines and mangrove forests , hydrology , soil erosion and disaster monitoring .
Technical training and data analysis workshops have been held , assistance in the provision of relevant equipment has been provided , and other such opportunities could be considered .
Furthermore , there could be interesting opportunities in the use of satellite communications services for tele-education and telemedicine , as well as for research into global change .
In the latter case , such cooperation could be facilitated on the American continent through the new Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research .
CSA and its partners in the implementation of CSP would welcome any suggestions from existing or potential new partners regarding possibilities for increased cooperation . B. India
1 . Space activities
In 1995 , as in past years , India continued to make significant progress in the development and application of space technology to promote rapid socio-economic development .
The Indian space programme also continued to further international cooperation in the exploration and peaceful uses of outer space .
( a ) Performance of INSAT
The two Indian-built multi-purpose satellites , INSAT-2A and INSAT-2B , respectively launched in July 1992 and July 1993 , together with INSAT-1D , launched in 1990 , provided uninterrupted services in the areas of telecommunication , television broadcasting , meteorology , disaster warning and distress alerts .
Development and fabrication of more advanced satellites in the INSAT-2 series , in particular INSAT-2C and INSAT-2D , have made good progress .
INSAT-2C , which was successfully launched on 6 December 1995 , will provide additional services , including mobile and business communications .
INSAT-2D , identical to INSAT-2C is to be launched in 1996 .
INSAT-2E , with advanced meteorological payloads in addition to communication payloads , is also being developed .
A few transponders on board INSAT-2E will be made available to INTELSAT .
The launch of INSAT-2E is planned for 1997 or 1998 .
New demonstrations and experiments designed to extend and enhance the INSAT services for various purposes , especially for new classes of telecommunication services and tele-education , are being conducted .
Several experiments and demonstrations involving satellite-based communication for interactive education and training have been successfully conducted for universities , village administration ( panchayat raj ) officials , special social groups and personnel from the industrial and commercial sector .
A channel of INSAT is exclusively used for interactive training and education .
This channel can be used for intensive , interactive training courses of long duration for special interest groups , without the usual constraints on the length and timing of the broadcast .
( b ) IRS satellites for natural resource management
The two Indian remote sensing satellites , IRS-1A and IRS-1B , respectively launched in March 1988 and August 1991 , together with IRS-P2 , launched by India with its own polar satellite launch vehicle ( PSLV ) , known as PSLV-D2 , in October 1994 , have become the mainstays of the national system for the management of natural resources .
The data from the IRS satellites are being put to use in important applications such as estimating agricultural crop acreage and yield , drought monitoring and assessment , flood mapping , land-use and land-cover mapping , wasteland management , survey and management of ocean and marine resources and of forest resources , urban planning and mineral prospecting .
Satellite-based remote sensing services , will be further enhanced through the launch of more advanced satellites , IRS-1C and IRS-1D , currently being developed .
These satellites will have better spatial and spectral resolutions than the present IRS satellites , stereo viewing capability and on-board recording facilities .
The launch of IRS-1C is planned for the first quarter of 1996 .
India has planned the launch of an IRS-P series of satellites on board its PSLV launch vehicle .
The series would be designed to test and demonstrate new and advanced technologies and applications of space-based remote sensing such as those for ocean resources monitoring and cartography .
India will provide opportunities for flying payloads from other countries on the IRS-P series of satellites .
( c ) Integrated mission on sustainable development
Action plans for the development of other areas in 174 districts all over the country , identified under IMSD , are being generated .
Priority has been given to 92 specific areas for generating action plans for integrated land and water resources development using IRS data .
The initial results of implementing the action plans generated under IMSD have been encouraging .
For example , in Ananthapur district in southern India , construction of water-harvesting structures have resulted in a substantial rise in the ground-water levels , enabling farmers there to grow two crops per year , a commendable achievement for an area with the second-lowest rainfall in the country .
( d ) Launch vehicle technology
PSLV-D2 placed the Indian remote sensing satellite , IRS-P2 , weighing 804 kilograms , into a polar sun-synchronous orbit at a height of about 817 kilometres .
The third developmental launch of PSLV ( PSLV-D3 ) is planned for the first quarter of 1996 .
The Government of India has already approved the launch of three more continuation flights , PSLV-C1 , PSLV-C2 and PSLV-C3 , over the next three years .
Those flights will be used to prove the reliability of PSLV , to increase its payload capability towards operationalization of the vehicle , and to launch satellites for Earth observation and scientific missions .
PSLV has also proved , in flight , many of the systems that go into the Indian geosynchronous satellite launch vehicle ( GSLV ) , intended for launching the Indian INSAT class of communication satellites into geosynchronous transfer orbit .
Development of GSLV is progressing well .
As a result of the suspension of transfer of cryogenic technology by Glavkosmos of the Russian Federation , India is developing its own cryogenic stage .
The first few flights of GSLV will , however , use the cryogenic stage supplied by Glavkosmos .
( e ) Pursuits in space science
India continues to pursue research in space science .
The SROSS-C2 satellite , put into orbit using the Indian launch vehicle ASLV-D4 , on 4 May 1994 , is providing valuable scientific data in astronomy and aeronomy from its two payloads , one for conducting the gamma ray burst experiment and the other consisting of a Retarding Potential Analyser ( RPA ) .
Several gamma ray bursts of potential celestial origin have been detected in the energy range of 20 to 3,000 kilo-electron-volts .
RPA has so far collected a few hundred sets of useful orbital ionospheric data over the Indian subcontinent , and interesting observations on the variation of electron and ion temperatures have been made .
The National Mesosphere-Stratosphere-Troposphere Radar Facility set up near Tirupati in southern India is helping atmospheric researchers .
The facility is also being used by international scientists to conduct experiments .
2 . International cooperation
India continues to pursue cooperation in space with several countries .
Recent agreements include those signed with the Russian Federation on 30 June 1994 and with Ukraine on 16 September 1994 .
India is to serve as host to a Centre for Space Science and Technology Education for the Asia-Pacific region , which is being established as a United Nations initiative .
Under the sharing of experience in space ( SHARES ) programme , several participants , specifically from developing countries , are being trained in the various aspects of space science and applications .
India is also playing an active role in the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites .
Data from IRS-1B and IRS-P2 are now available to users all over the world .
3 . Conclusion
With the satellites designed and built by India in the INSAT and IRS series performing to specification , the country has started to reap the benefits of space technology for developmental applications , specifically in the areas of communication , broadcasting , meteorology , disaster management and the survey and management of resources .
The planned launches of more powerful satellites in the two series will further enhance and extend the benefits of space technology .
The successful launch of PSLV and the progress made in the development of GSLV have inspired confidence in the capability of India to launch the IRS and INSAT class of satellites from its own soil .
Thus , India today has a well-integrated and self-supporting space programme which is providing important services to society . C. Jamaica
Jamaica reports that it has not yet established a national space programme .
D. Japan 1 . National organizations for space activities
( a ) Space Activities Commission
The Space Activities Commission ( SAC ) was established within the Office of the Prime Minister in 1968 under the Law for the Establishment of the Space Activities Commission as the body to succeed to , and carry on the work of , the National Space Activities Council , which had been functioning since 1960 . Its purpose was to unify the space activities of various government agencies and actively promote them .
SAC formulates plans , deliberates and takes decisions on the matters listed below , and submits its opinions to the Prime Minister , whose decision is guided by the opinion of SAC thus submitted .
The matters dealt with by SAC are as follows :
( a ) Important policy matters relating to space activities ;
( b ) Important matters bearing on the coordination of space-related work among the government agencies concerned ;
( c ) Estimates of space activity expenses of the government agencies concerned ;
( d ) Matters relating to the development and training of space researchers and engineers ( excluding instruction and research at universities or colleges ) ;
( e ) Other important matters concerning space activities .
SAC consists of five persons noted for their learning , nominated by the Prime Minister following approval by the Diet , and including the Minister of State for Science and Technology serving as Chairman .
Its secretariat functions are performed by the Space Policy Division of the Research and Development Bureau of the Science and Technology Agency ( STA ) .
( b ) Science and Technology Agency
STA established the Space Science and Technology Preparation Office in May 1960 , thereby starting space activities for the first time through an organization of the Government of Japan .
In July 1964 , STA set up the National Space Development Centre to serve as the primary promoter of space activities in Japan .
Attracting able personnel from industry , the academic world and Government and maintaining flexible budgetary and organizational procedures and mechanisms are necessary to ensure the full and effective implementation of space activities .
To that end , STA reorganized the National Space Development Centre into the National Space Development Agency ( NASDA ) of Japan , a special entity under the law , in operation since 1969 .
STA now plans and promotes basic space-related policy and the overall coordination of space activities among government agencies , and conducts research and development activities through the National Aerospace Laboratory ( NAL ) , a research organization attached to it , and NASDA .
It thereby plays the central role in the space activities of Japan .
As the secretariat of SAC , STA also maintains liaison and conducts negotiations between various government agencies , thereby allowing smooth and effective development and utilization of space science and technology .
( c ) National Aerospace Laboratory
NAL , formerly called the National Aeronautical Laboratory , was established in July 1955 as a subsidiary organization of the Office of the Prime Minister to expedite the development of aeronautical technology in Japan .
After the establishment of STA in 1956 , NAL was placed under its administration .
In 1963 , NAL was charged with the additional task of conducting research in space technology and renamed National Aerospace Laboratory .
NAL established its Rocket Division in 1963 and its Kakuda Research Centre in 1966 to allow research on a broader scale .
The Rocket Division was reorganized into the Space Technology Research Group in October 1969 to encourage progress in space research within a stronger , more fully structured organization .
Since then , the Space Technology Research Group and the Kakuda Research Centre have played a dominant role in the development of space technology in NAL , although close cooperation with other divisions is occasionally required .
Most NAL divisions are conducting research on key technologies for winged systems of space transport , which NAL considers essential to the pursuit of autonomous space activities by Japan in the coming century .
NAL has strong connections with NASDA , with which it jointly conducts various experiments required for the development of space technology .
The liquid oxygen turbopump developed at the Kakuda Research Centre is installed in the LE-7 engine .
The principal activities of NAL in the field of space technology are as follows :
( a ) Research on basic technologies for spaceplanes , with the focus on aerodynamics , advanced composite structures , flight control , propulsion systems , manned space flight and orbiter manoeuvring engines ;
( b ) Joint research with NASDA on the aerodynamics , guidance and control , and structure of the H-II Orbiting Plane ( HOPE ) ;
( c ) Research on oxygen-hydrogen rocket engine components ;
( d ) Research on satellite systems and utilization of the space environment .
( d ) National Space Development Agency of Japan
NASDA was established by law in October 1969 as the central body responsible for the development of space technology in Japan and the promotion of space activities solely for peaceful purposes .
The main tasks of NASDA are to develop satellites and their launching vehicles ; to launch and track the satellites and promote the utilization of space technology ; and to devise methods , facilities and organizations for those purposes in accordance with the Space Development Programme .
To perform its tasks , NASDA has facilities in various parts of the country .
NASDA has orbited various satellites by means of N-I , N-II , H-I and H-II launch vehicles . It has launched a total of seven satellites with the N-I vehicle , the first , the Engineering Test Satellite I ( ETS-I ) , in September 1975 .
Since 1981 , eight meteorological , telecommunications and broadcasting satellites have been launched with the N-II , and the H-I made a record 9 successful launches after its maiden flight in 1986 .
To meet the demand for launching large-scale satellites in the 1990s , NASDA developed the H-II launch vehicle with 100 per cent Japanese technology , and its first flight was successfully made in February 1994 .
NASDA is also striving , from a long-range , system-based perspective , to promote research and development in materials processing through test projects , and to implement the space station programme involving the United States Space Shuttle , thereby further expanding the scope of space activities in Japan .
( i ) Tanegashima Space Centre
The Tanegashima Space Centre has a total land area of 8.6 million square metres . The site has launch pads for H-II , J-1 and TR-IA rockets , communication and test facilities and optical and radio wave systems .

In SEPAC , accelerated ion and electron beams were ejected from the space shuttle .
In 1992 , the Geotail satellite developed by ISAS was launched by NASA using a Delta II launch vehicle .
The Geotail satellite carries scientific instruments developed by both ISAS and NASA .
( f ) Ministry of Transport
The space-related organizations under the Ministry of Transport are the Transport Policy Bureau acting as a headquarters , the Electronic Navigation Research Institute as a subsidiary organization , and the Maritime Safety Agency and the Japan Meteorological Agency as affiliated agencies .
Those bodies have been using meteorological , geodetic and aeronautical satellites , and accumulating knowledge about their use .
Recently , the importance of space technology and its use in the field of transport has increased , as reflected in such areas as meteorological and maritime observation , maritime geodetic control , search and rescue of ships and aircraft , air traffic control and operational control of ships , aircraft and land vehicles .
In addition , space technology , such as large-scale geostationary satellite technology , has been steadily progressing .
It is now believed that it would be much more economical and effective to launch a large , multi-purpose satellite instead of launching several kinds of satellites separately in order to conduct meteorological observations and air traffic control .
As a result , the Ministry of Transport has been investigating the possibility of establishing a multi-purpose satellite system to cover all its needs .
The Ministry plans to conduct a search and rescue experiment to relay ship distress signals using the geostationary meteorological satellite-5 ( GMS-5 ) , launched in March 1995 .
The Ministry also supervises NASDA , a quasi-governmental agency , thus exercising control over satellite development .
Important projects under way include the following :
( a ) The Electronic Navigation Research Institute is conducting research and development work on satellite-based technologies for air navigation and air traffic control .
Major research and development projects undertaken in those areas are as follows : automatic dependence surveillance , a system that gives pseudo-radar images to air traffic controllers by using aircraft-derived position data transmitted through a satellite data link ; and the wide area augmentation system , a system that improves the integrity , accuracy and availability of the Global Positioning System ( GPS ) for civil aviation in Japan ;
( b ) Development of a GPS overlay , a system that recovers the accuracy degradation of the GPS system by using GPS signals transmitted by a geostationary satellite ;
( c ) Development of a satellite data link , a system that improves the communication quality and surveillance capability of air traffic control for the safety of transoceanic flights .
( i ) Maritime Safety Agency
To establish Japanese territorial waters , the positions of the mainland and the off-lying islands must be registered with the World Geodetic System ( WGS ) .
The Maritime Safety Agency has therefore been participating in a joint international observation plan using the United States laser geodynamics satellite ( LAGEOS ) since 1982 to fix the precise positions of the mainland based on WGS .
The Agency has been conducting a maritime geodetic survey to determine , to a high degree of accuracy , the positions of the mainland and its off-lying islands and the distances between them , using the geodetic satellite of Japan , AJISAI , launched in August 1986 .
( ii ) Japan Meteorological Agency
The Japan Meteorological Agency conducts space-based meteorological observations using GMS and meteorological rockets as part of the World Weather Watch programme of the World Meteorological Organization ( WMO ) .
GMS observes cloud coverage and temperatures of sea surface and cloud top , and collects meteorological data from aircraft , buoys and meteorological observation stations in remote areas .
It also distributes by facsimile the cloud image charts thus obtained .
As the ground facility to operate GMS , the Agency has the Meteorological Satellite Centre , which comprises the Data Processing Centre for image data processing and the Command and Data Acquisition Station for communication between the Data Processing Centre and GMS .
The satellite data serve to improve weather forecasting on an operational basis , and are used in the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project ( ISCCP ) and the Global Precipitation Climatology Project ( GPCP ) of WMO .
In addition , the Data Processing Centre receives and analyses data from the polar-orbiting meteorological satellites of the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .
The meteorological rockets observe temperature , atmospheric pressure , wind etc. at altitudes of between 30 and 60 kilometres .
Launching of the meteorological rockets are carried out by the Meteorological Rocket Observation Station , the sole facility capable of meteorological rocket observation in East Asia and the western Pacific .
The Meteorological Research Institute develops techniques for the more effective use of meteorological satellite data , and conducts studies on sensors for the next generation of meteorological satellites .

( ii ) Telecommunications Advancement Organization of Japan
The Telecommunications Satellite Corporation of Japan was renewed as TAO in 1992 .
The Corporation was established in 1979 to develop radio communications and seek effective utilization of radio waves in space by controlling the location , attitude etc. of communications and broadcasting satellites and efficiently using the telecommunications facilities installed on those satellites .
The main tasks of TAO are as follows :
( a ) Controlling the location , attitude etc. of communications and broadcasting satellites ;
( b ) Ensuring that radio systems on communications and broadcasting satellites are used by operators of radio stations .
The Kimitsu Satellite Control Centre tracks and controls satellites .
CS-3 , N-STAR , and BS-3 are currently tracked and controlled using six antennas ( in the 10 to 18 diameter class ) .
To promote the spread of high-vision satellite broadcasting ( high-definition television ) , TAO owns one of the transponders aboard BS-3b , and leases it to NHK and commercial broadcasting companies .
( h ) Other organizations
In addition to the above-mentioned organizations , the Ministry of International Trade and Industry , the National Police Agency , the Geographical Survey Institute of the Ministry of Construction and the Fire Defence Agency of the Ministry of Home Affairs have made space-related budgetary appropriations .

The deterioration of land use as a result of human activity and the extent of urban development in the Amman Greater Area is being investigated for the period between 1945 and 1994 , using satellite imagery and aerial photography .
The role of satellite data and GIS techniques in land use is exemplified by a study undertaken to establish optimum land use in the Irbid area by investigating the geomorphological , topographical , land-cover and agricultural aspects of the area .
A project on the desertification of Al-Azraq wetlands monitors environmental pollution in the Al-Azraq area using multi-temporal analysis for the period between 1975 and 1994 to show the diminishing of the natural plant cover as a result of irrigated vegetation and the consequent depletion of water reserves in the area .
( c ) Other projects
Using aerial photographs , remote sensing and GIS , landslide hazard detection is being performed on the Amman-Jerash motorway in order to suggest an alternative route .
Another project involves landslide mapping using SAR in the Al-Zarqa river basin .
Landslide hazards in the Wadi Al-Karak basin are also being studied using GIS and SPOT images to delineate areas of existing landslides and of probable landslides .
The Department of Meteorology of Jordan conducts space activities through its two satellite stations , one of which is installed at the old airport , the other at the Queen Alia International Airport .
The latter station is used for receiving pictures from Meteosat satellites two or three times daily , especially for cloud cover and plantation coverage .
The cloud pictures are mainly used for aviation forecasting , and there is a weather radar .
The Department operates 13 meteorological stations .
There are two more stations used exclusively for monitoring pollution and a network of solar radiation recording stations .
Since 1986 , a programme for enhancing rainfall through cloud-seeding from the ground with silver iodide has been implemented .
According to some estimates , there has been a 19 per cent increase in precipitation .
There is also a programme to monitor surface temperatures of the Mediterranean Sea and to compare them with actual on-site measurements in ships .
At Aqaba , temperature accuracy by the two methods has been noted to be of the order of 1.5 degrees centigrade .
2 . Multilateral cooperation and national telecommunications policy
Jordan is a member of the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization ( INTELSAT ) .
The Department of Space Telecommunications in the Ministry of Communications of Jordan is in charge of international telephone and television traffic and the promotion of satellite communications for the public and private sectors , utilizing the satellites of INTELSAT and the Arab Satellite Communications Organization .
Jordan has three ground receiving stations which are used in the exchange of television programmes all over the world , and in retransmission from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean and vice versa .
Jordan has direct dial services with 140 countries .
Direct dial services are established not only via satellite but also via submarine cables routed through the territory of the Syrian Arab Republic .
Regular telephone lines are used for fax services , and require approval in accordance with international standards .
Since 1986 , the Government of Jordan has reconsidered the role of its postal , telephone and telegraph services in national development by extending narrow- and wide-band services of the Integrated Services Digital Network .
Offering incentives to attract private investors to the telecommunications sector and assigning them a definite role in expanding and upgrading the system have also been considered .
The Government has already completed the first phase of implementation of a restructured telecommunications policy permitting private sector involvement in the sector through the provision of services such as cellular telephony and data transmission . F. South Africa
The following is a compilation of summary reports of space-related activities of South Africa during the past year . 1 . South African Astronomical Observatory
Unquestionably the highlight of 1994 was the collision of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 with Jupiter .
All four telescopes at the Sutherland observatory were scheduled to observe the event .
The most spectacular results were obtained with the infrared camera on the 0.75-metre telescope , which showed the development of the fireball resulting from the impact of each fragment .
The public interest and media coverage were phenomenal , and included live coverage of the largest fragment , Q1 .
Sutherland was extremely well-placed to observe seven of the impacts , the weather was favourable , and all were recorded .
In addition to the &quot; the great crash of 1994 &quot; , research at the South African Astronomical Observatory ( SAAO ) has been carried out over a wide range of astronomical topics , frequently involving international collaboration .
SAAO participated in ground-based , multiwavelength observations of sources detected by space observatories and in concerted campaigns focused on individual targets as determined by the time-critical nature of the observations .
The input of data from an observatory in the southern hemisphere at the longitude of SAAO is essential to the success of the campaigns .
Cosmological studies at SAAO have continued primarily by measuring the line-of-sight velocities of galaxies .
This has contributed to determining the correlation length of X-ray emitting clusters of galaxies , the distribution of galaxies in the southern hemisphere and the mapping of large-scale structures behind the Milky Way .
Contributions to the understanding of the Galaxy have been based principally on infrared observations .
From SiO maser sources towards the galactic centre , the average rotation period of the galactic bulge was found to be 8.5 x 107 years .
Infrared astronomical satellite ( IRAS ) sources in the Sagittarius-I field were studied and their properties compared to those in the Large Magellanic Cloud and solar neighbourhood .
An infrared survey of the galactic centre for variables has been initiated using a wide-format infrared array camera .
A study of IRAS sources in the south galactic cap has shown that they are mostly non-Mira M or S stars , probably a mixed population and similar to those of the inner bulge of the Galaxy .
As a result of the follow-up of R√∂ntgen Satellite X-ray sources , a number of interesting magnetic cataclysmic variables have been discovered .
These interacting binary systems reveal a remarkable variety of astrophysical phenomena depending upon the strength of the magnetic field of the white dwarf .
Spectroscopic , photometric and polarimetric observations are essential to interpret the physical properties of the systems .
Substantial progress has been made in the study of pulsating stars , with SAAO participating frequently in multisite campaigns , which are necessary to elucidate the nature of some variables .
Discoveries have been made of new pulsating stars , including members of rare classes , and a new class of pulsating F-type star has been established .
The radii of galactic Cepheids , which are fundamental distance calibrators , have been determined more accurately than hitherto by using extensive infrared , optical and radial velocity data .
In 1994 , the results of research by SAAO staff and other astronomers using the facilities of SAAO were published in 146 papers in astronomical journals and in conference proceedings .
The publications that included SAAO authors exceeded those of previous years .
Over 60 per cent of the papers appeared in referred journals .
The number of papers published in 1995 was not available at the time of writing the present report , but it is expected to exceed that of 1994 .
A comprehensive document on the funding of the Southern African Large Telescope has been completed and distributed to scientists , decision makers and potential international partners .
An international working group to promote the project , involving representatives from Germany , Namibia and South Africa , was established , and held two meetings during 1994 , one in Germany and one in Namibia .
On the technological side , the large-format platinum-silicon infrared camera ( the outcome of collaboration between SAAO and Japan ) was improved , the optical charge-coupled device ( CCD ) was developed further , and a highly successful CCD autoguider was commissioned on the 1.9 metre telescope .
Software techniques have been developed for the automatic reduction and analysis of differential CCD photometry .
An SAAO Differential Image Motion Monitor ( DIMM ) to measure seeing has been commissioned and tested at Sutherland , and compared with a European Southern Observatory DIMM on the Gamsberg in Namibia .
The quality of the dome seeing in the building with the 1.0-metre telescope has been substantially improved as a result .
An important development has been the SAAO education initiative , which is aimed at stimulating an interest in basic science among young people through contact with astronomy .
A resource centre has been created for teachers , courses for teacher training are being developed , and there are plans to include astronomy in the physical science syllabus of schools .
Astronomy has a natural appeal to the young , and can have a very positive effect in stimulating an interest in science and technology .
Such an interest is vital to the future development of South Africa .
In 1994 , SAAO organized the Annual Review of South African Astronomy and Astrophysics , which included participants from overseas and from nine South African universities and institutes .
A month-long Summer School in Astronomy was held at Cape Town for selected third-year physics and mathematics students from South African universities .
2 . Department of Posts and Telecommunications
South Africa has been a member of the INTELSAT since its establishment and of the International Mobile Satellite Organization ( Inmarsat ) since 1994 .
South Africa makes use of the satellites of INTELSAT for its public traffic with foreign countries ( including some countries in Africa ) and for the distribution of broadcasting signals in South Africa .
For communication between fixed points and vehicles or between fixed points and areas where telecommunication infrastructure does not exist , the satellites of Inmarsat are used .
In addition to the INTELSAT system , broadcasters started using the satellite service of PANAMSAT during 1995 .
This system will also be used by Transnet , the communications unit of the public railway utility , for its own communications .
Towards the end of 1993 , so-called Ku-band INTELSAT services became available for South Africa , enabling Telkom SA Ltd . , the public telecommunications operator of South Africa , to provide dedicated , small satellite terminals to clients whose volume of traffic justifies a dedicated satellite service .
A lively commercial interest in the provision of telecommunication service by means of satellites continues . South Africa was recently requested by a United States / South African consortium to register frequencies for a new satellite system with the International Telecommunication Union ( ITU ) .
This satellite system is expected to become operational in 1998 .
It is proposed to provide space segment capacity to countries in the southern African subregion .
3 . University of Stellenbosh
SUNSAT is a 60-kilogram microsatellite being developed by a team of 27 graduate students at the University of Stellenbosh .
Its prime research role is to test a 15-metre-resolution , tricolour pushbroom imager with a 45-kilometre swath on a microsatellite of that size . Is also carries an amateur radio communications package for international and national use .
This satellite , the first developed by a South African university , is a significant research project for the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at the University .
A schools project is being run in association with the South African Amateur Radio Satellite Organization ( SA-AMSAT ) .
SUNSAT is gravity-gradient-stabilized for minimum energy consumption , but includes magnetictorquers , small reaction wheels and precision horizon sensors for attitude control to miliradian accuracy .
It uses a system concept that can be realized without the need for conventional space-reliability components .
NASA agreed to launch SUNSAT as a secondary payload on the Delta II Argos / P91-1 mission .
In exchange , SUNSAT was increased to a height of 62 centimeters to fly laser reflectors and a NASA precision GPS receiver for research in gravity recovery and atmospheric tomography as part of the NASA Mission to Planet Earth .
Modal survey tests and other structural evaluations have shown SUNSAT to be satisfactory for carriage on the Delta II .
SUNSAT will also carry a scientific magnetometer .
Together with data from the Danish Oersted satellite , which will be released in the same orbit as SUNSAT , it can provide valuable magnetic research information .
The mission , originally scheduled for January 1996 , has been delayed to March 1997 .
A launch in May 1996 on another mission is being investigated by NASA .
Construction of the flight model of SUNSAT has started , and will be accelerated to meet the May 1996 launch date , if required .
The project is funded at a minimal level by a group of electronics companies in South Africa and by the Foundation for Research Development .
It relies on the goodwill of other companies to perform environmental tests , to manufacture various structural components , and to obtain donations of components from a number of suppliers .
The project has developed some subsystems for use by other satellites , and is seeking partners .
A number of international student exchanges have already occurred .
Further information on SUNSAT is available on the Internet WWW at http : / / esl.ee.sun.ac.za and arnsat.orq.4 .
University of the Witwatersrand
Professor David Block , of the Department of Computational and Applied Mathematics at the University of the Witwatersrand , at Johannesburg , is the leader of an international team of astronomers that has achieved a breakthrough in the imaging of intergalactic cold dust .
An International Conference of Astronomers will be held at the University of the Witwatersrand from 22 to 26 January 1996 to focus on changing perceptions of the morphology , dust content and dust-to-gas ratios of galaxies .
This will probably be the largest astronomical conference ever held in South Africa .
5 . Satellite Applications Centre
The Satellite Applications Centre of the South African Council for Scientific and Industrial Research ( CSIR ) is located at Hartebeesthoek , in the vicinity of Johannesburg .
It has business interests in remote sensing and satellite tracking services .
Remote sensing as a business is based on the reception , processing and distribution of resource data from the polar orbiting satellites of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) , the LANDSAT thematic mapper sensor , the French SPOT series ( panchromatic and multispectral data ) and the SAR sensors of ESA ERS-1 and ERS-2 .
Digital archives are maintained ; in some cases the records date from 1972 .
Thanks to the geographic position of the Centre at Hartebeesthoek , its data acquisition programmes cover the entire southern African region up to the equator , including also Madagascar .
Data products conforming to international standards are being supplied to users worldwide , and are increasingly being supplemented by value-added products in map format , for use in GIS .
The Centre has its second area of business in the provision of tracking , telemetry and command services , 24 hours per day , all year round .
The facility is part of the CNES 2-gigahertz network .
6 . Hartebeesthoek Radio Astronomy Observatory
Within the same complex as the Satellite Applications Centre , South Africa operates the Hartebeesthoek Radio Astronomy Observatory ( HARTRAO ) .
Although primarily used for astronomical research , the 26-metre radio telescope is actively involved in space geodesy , using VLBI techniques to measure plate tectonic motions of all continents with respect to Africa .
HARTRAO also makes supporting radio observations of objects currently being investigated by the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory .
HARTRAO will make its facilities available as a ground support VLBI station for the Japanese MUSES-B satellite in 1996 and for the Radioastron satellite of the Russian Federation when it is launched .
7 . Other ongoing research
South African Universities have , during 1995 , been involved in a number of other projects , as exemplified by the work done by the Space Physics Research Institute at the Durban campus of the University of Natal .
The research programme of the Institute includes research in magnetospheric and atmospheric physics .
The major programmes are Antarctic Magnetosphere-Ionosphere Ground-base Observations ( AMIGO ) , Southern Hemisphere Auroral Radar Experiment ( SHARE ) and General Magnetospheric Studies and Ozone Studies .
SHARE and AMIGO form part of the South African National Antarctic Research Programme , which is carried out at Sanae Base in the Antarctic in collaboration with other research institutions in South Africa and other countries .
The outer space activities of Thailand are focused on two areas : remote sensing and communications .
1 . Remote sensing
( a ) Background
The Thailand Remote Sensing Centre ( TRSC ) , under the auspices of the National Research Council of Thailand ( NRCT ) , is the national centre for remote sensing activities .
TRSC was established in 1971 , and its activities are directed by the National Remote Sensing Coordinating Committee , whose members are representatives of relevant agencies .
In 1981 , the ground receiving station was completely constructed , enabling it to receive LANDSAT signals with the radius of data reception extending approximately 2,800 kilometres from Bangkok .
The Thailand Ground Receiving Station currently has the capability to receive data from a variety of satellites , including LANDSAT , SPOT , ERS-1 SAR imagery , and MOS , JERS and NOAA advanced very high resolution radiometer data .
Remote sensing activities conducted in fiscal year 1995 are reviewed below .
( b ) Data reception , production and distribution
Planning for data acquisition is carried out daily by the Satellite Operations Centre .
The receiving station routinely acquires and stores data in the digital tape archives .
Satellite data are supplied via computer compatible tapes ( CCTs ) , paper print and film , in accordance with user requirements .
In 1995 , TRSC provided domestic and international customers with a total of 1,067 photographs and 508 CCTs containing satellite data .
( c ) Data applications
Satellite data have been utilized in many fields , including agriculture , forestry , land use and land cover mapping , geology , map updating , natural disaster monitoring and environmental studies .
In the field of agriculture , satellite images have been used for crop acreage surveys and mapping as well as agricultural planning .
Forest applications include forest area estimation and mapping , forest monitoring , forest fire assessment and forest management .
Other applications include flood disaster monitoring and assessment and the application of remote sensing and GIS in matters of national security .
Besides TRSC , other government units are involved in remote sensing applications , including the Department of Agricultural Extension , the Department of Agriculture , the Department of Forestry , the Department of Land Development and the Office of Agricultural Economics .
( d ) Education , training and research
Most of the universities in Thailand , such as Chulalongkhon University , Kasetsart University , Thammasart University , Chiangmai University and Khon Kaen University , have included remote sensing in their regular syllabus .
TRSC has organized both training in and seminars on remote sensing and GIS , and has so far trained nearly 500 participants from various agencies , including civil service departments , military offices and educational institutions .
Each year , TRSC has granted 3 million baht to remote sensing projects proposed by Thai researchers as a means of promoting applications of the technology in Thailand .
In 1995 , nine research projects were funded under the grant .
( e ) Regional remote sensing centres
In 1994 , TRSC established regional remote sensing centres in three regions , with the objective of promoting the utilization of satellite data and transferring remote sensing and GIS technologies to the regional level .
Three educational institutions , well endowed with the necessary facilities and resource persons have been appointed as regional centres , namely Chiangmai University in the northern region , Prince of Songkhla University in the southern region and Khon Kaen University in the north-eastern region .
In 1995 , TRSC supported the regional centres in terms of both the budget and resource persons for the promotion of remote sensing applications and the transfer of technology to local users and students in the regions through seminars , training , workshops , university courses and research projects .
The three regional centres organized three seminars , which were attended by a total of 367 participants from 182 agencies .
( f ) Publications
TRSC publishes two quarterly newsletters for dissemination of information to users , one version in Thai and the other in English .
It also publishes an annual report in Thai summarizing the activities of the centre over the past year .
Most research work is reported in Thai , except when conducted in cooperation with international organizations .
( g ) International cooperation
Besides working with the relevant agencies in Thailand , TRSC has also cooperated with agencies in other countries and with international organizations .
Cooperative projects conducted in 1995 include : the Regional Remote Sensing ERS-1 Project of the European Communities and ASEAN ; the GlobeSAR Project ; the Global Research Network System Project ; Joint Research on Enhancement of Remote Sensing Technology in Tropical Environment Monitoring ; Joint Research on the Changes of Tropical Forest and their Influence ; and the Asian JERS-1 Project .
TRSC also initiated cooperation with the Lao People &apos;s Democratic Republic .
The first cooperative activity was the Workshop on Application of Remote Sensing and GIS for Natural Resources Management , held at Vientiane .
( h ) Seawatch Thailand Programme
The Seawatch Thailand Programme is a marine surveillance and information system consisting of a network of moored data buoys in the Gulf of Thailand collecting meteorological and oceanographical data for the database at NRCT .
Authorized users can transfer data through the Oceaninfo system or receive monthly plots by mail .
( i ) Smallsat Programme
An Earth observation small satellite mission has been approved in principle by the Government of Thailand .
The Ministry of Science , Technology and Environment , through its technical authority in NRCT and in cooperation with the Canadian Space Agency , will own and operate the satellite system .
The satellite is scheduled to be launched in 1998 , with the parameters indicated in the table below .

2 . Space activities and projects of the Ministry of Transport and Communications
( a ) Asia-Pacific multilateral cooperation on space technology and applications
Originally , China , Pakistan and Thailand signed a memorandum of understanding to organize workshops and conferences in each country concerned .
The Republic of Korea subsequently joined the arrangement and the four countries agreed on the following two space projects : the Small Multi-Mission Satellite ( SMMS ) and the Satellite Disaster Mitigation System ( SDMS ) .
The SMMS project has been progressing , and details of cooperation were discussed during conferences held at Bangkok in 1994 and Islamabad in 1995 .
China prepared a memorandum of understanding on the project , which was to be signed by the four countries concerned by the end of 1995 .
( b ) Coordination of geostationary satellite orbital positions
Thailand has been using one position at 78.5 degrees east , which co-located Thaicom 1 and 2 .
Thailand is seeking to achieve coordination and cooperation through the project
( c ) National communications satellite ( Thaicom )
To cope with the increasing demands of communication by satellite , the Government of Thailand and the Shinawatra Company have signed an agreement on domestic satellite communications allowing the Company to provide satellite communications under a 30-year concession .
The specifications for the first two satellites are as follows :
( a ) Thaicom-1 and -2 are identical .
Each satellite has 10 C-band transponders and two Ku-band transponders ;
( b ) The effective isotropically radiated power ( EIRP ) for the coverage of Thailand on C-Band is at 37 decibels above 1 watt , with a bandwidth of 36 megahertz .
The EIRP for the Ku-Band is 50 decibels above 1 watt , and its bandwidth is 54 megahertz .
( d ) Membership of international organizations
Thailand has been a member of INTELSAT since its inception , and it recently became a member of Inmarsat , thus enabling it to provide international telecommunication services all over the world .
Since other facilities , such as mobile telephones , are usually provided through private international dealings , the possibility of allowing private firms in Thailand to join the Iridium programme and provide services is being considered .

INTRODUCTION
As part of the 1995 activities of the United Nations Programme on Space Applications of the Office for Outer Space Affairs of the United Nations , a Symposium entitled &quot; Space Technology for Improving Life on Earth &quot; was jointly organized at Graz , Austria , by the United Nations and the Government of Austria .
The Symposium , serving as a follow-up to the Workshop entitled &quot; Enhancing Social , Economic and Environmental Security Through Space Technology &quot; held at Graz in 1994 , was designed to build on the experience gained during that Workshop .
The Symposium was hosted by the Federal Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Austria and co-sponsored by the State of Styria , the City of Graz , the European Space Agency ( ESA ) and the Commission of the European Communities .
The main objective of the Symposium was to promote the use of space technology to improve living and economic conditions in developing countries .
In that regard , the meeting focused primarily on policy and management issues involved in national , regional and international space programmes , and on how those issues related to the exploitation of space technology for sustainable development , taking into account the social and economic conditions of the developing countries concerned .
Through presentations and panel discussions , the Symposium addressed key areas of concern identified by the 1994 Workshop , placed emphasis on matching existing and expected space capabilities with existing and foreseen needs for those capabilities , and sought to identify ways to involve high-level policy and decision makers in developing countries in making use of space technologies in support of national development plans and programmes .
Recommendations were made on how to convince policy and decision makers in developing countries that space systems could contribute to social and economic security .
That was accomplished primarily by addressing the problems caused by insufficient information in the areas of education , environmental monitoring , management of natural resources and disaster warning , mitigation and prevention .
The present report was prepared for the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and its Scientific and Technical Subcommittee .
Participants were expected to report to the relevant authorities in their countries .
B. Programme
Presentations delivered during the Symposium addressed the issue of how satellite remote sensing and satellite communications could provide accurate and timely information considered to be essential for policy formulation and effective decision-making in developing countries .
Presentations also covered case-studies and pilot projects on the use of satellite technology to enhance food security , education and health , and to upgrade communications infrastructure and disaster early warning systems .
Throughout the Symposium , actions were identified that could convince high-level policy and decision makers in developing countries of the costs and benefits inherent in the use of well-chosen applications of space technology for sustainable development .
International and national institutions that were actively involved in space activities were invited to present an overview of programmes and specific applications in which cooperative activities with institutions from developing countries could be undertaken .
Some institutions from developing countries identified areas where their countries were or could be utilizing space technology to assist in formulating policy or implementing management decisions concerning , inter alia , sustainable exploitation of natural resources and preservation of the environment .
C. Participants
The United Nations invited developing countries to nominate candidates to participate in the Symposium .
Participants from the countries concerned held positions in institutions or private industry dealing with resource management , protection of the environment , communications , remote sensing systems , industrial and technological development and other fields related to the themes of the Symposium .
The participants were also selected because of their work in programmes , projects and enterprises in which space technology could be utilized .
They were asked to highlight , in their presentations , the key issues that would persuade them to place a higher priority on the operational implementation of space applications .
Funds allocated by the United Nations , ESA , the Commission of the European Communities and the Government of Austria were used to cover the travel cost and per diem expenses of participants from developing countries .
The following Member States and international organizations were represented at the Symposium : Bahrain , Brazil , Cambodia , Chile , China , Colombia , Egypt , Ghana , India , Iran ( Islamic Republic of ) , Jordan , Kenya , Lebanon , Malawi , Malaysia , Mexico , Nicaragua , Pakistan , Peru , Philippines , Russian Federation , Senegal , Sierra Leone , Sri Lanka , Thailand , Uganda , United Republic of Tanzania , Venezuela , Viet Nam , and Zimbabwe ; Office for Outer Space Affairs , International Telecommunication Union ( ITU ) and World Meteorological Organization ( WMO ) ; and Commission of the European Communities , ESA , International Astronautical Federation ( IAF ) , Inter-American Development Bank and International Space University ( ISU ) .
Speakers , chairmen , panellists and participants from Austria , Belgium , Canada , France , Germany , Italy , United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America also contributed to the success of the meeting .
I. PRESENTATIONS AND DISCUSSIONS DURING THE SYMPOSIUM
A. General themes
Presentations made during the course of the Symposium focused on how national and international space agencies should implement , in cooperation with developing countries , pilot projects to demonstrate the usefulness of space technology to policy makers .
As transnational industrial cooperation had become an important factor in shaping the character of space activities throughout the world , emphasis was also placed on increasing cooperation across national borders among private companies .
The global concern for the environment and sustainable development had led countries to cooperate further and make available a wider range of space-based technologies and know-how to other countries .
It was noted , however , that many policy issues remained to be addressed if space technology was to be further developed in the light of current world economic constraints .
Areas that required such policy review included financing , technology transfer , data dissemination , national , regional and international cooperation , institutional arrangements and national security .
Within the next 35 years , the world population would increase by 50 per cent , from about 6 billion in 1995 to about 9 billion in 2030 .
Food production would therefore have to be increased , requiring a more efficient management of natural resources .
Participants agreed that the information technologies of remote sensing and geographical information systems ( GIS ) would play a vital role in meeting those requirements .
Presentations also focused on human-induced environmental changes , particularly in developing countries , such as deforestation , which had had a dramatic impact on food production , supplies of fuel wood and fodder , soil fertility and water resources .
In terms of improving forest management , it was noted that one of the primary measures to be implemented was the development of techniques that would provide rapid and accurate information about forest conditions .
In that regard , emphasis was placed on one solution that had become operational , involving information generated by the synoptic coverage provided by Earth observation satellites .
Participants agreed that only by using data from such satellites would it be possible to monitor and quantify forest resources when whole countries or continents were involved .
B. Earth observation for sustainable development
In the field of Earth observation for sustainable development , WMO had developed a policy and practice for the international exchange of meteorological data and products .
The new policy included the free and unrestricted exchange of meteorological data essential for meteorological and hydrological services .
It also met the requirements of data and information exchange of several international conventions such as the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change ( A / AC.237 / 18 ( Part II ) / Add.1 and Corr.1 , annex I ) and the International Convention to Combat Natural Disasters .
With regard to education and training in satellite applications , the strategy adopted by WMO for satellite operators participating in the WMO Global Observing System ( GOS ) was to cooperate with at least one of its specialized satellite applications training centres located around the globe .
In response to that policy , the Council of the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites ( EUMETSAT ) had recently decided to co-sponsor two training centres in Africa .
Participants agreed that the utilization of Earth observation satellite data in developing countries still needed to be increased .
In that context , the representative of ESA noted that it would focus on areas in which improvements were essential for successful projects based on remote sensing for sustainable development .
Those areas included ensuring the continuity of remote sensing data from satellite operators , technical assistance in the implementation and operation of ground stations , price reductions and easier access to data , provision of training and education for efficient and timely data processing and analysis , and increased efforts in the coordination of programmes and projects between national , regional and international aid agencies .
Currently , ESA systems of European remote sensing satellites ( ERS ) , known as ERS-1 and ERS-2 , provided developing countries in particular with repetitive and continued environmental monitoring .
ERS data were provided free of charge to selected scientific research groups or entities involved in operational applications .
In the near future , the ESA satellites ENVISAT-1 and METOP-1 , under a joint project with EUMETSAT , were scheduled to be launched .
Scientific and technological cooperation between developing countries and the Commission of the European Communities was becoming an increasingly important and comprehensive activity with regard to the transfer of technology and knowledge .
In that context , the Commission had launched a study entitled &quot; Analysis of the constraints and opportunities for cost-effective implementation of Earth observation techniques in developing countries &quot; .
The overall objective of the study was to facilitate decisions on future European investments in space technology applications by providing an assessment of potential opportunities in developing countries for remote sensing of Earth .
A major Canadian initiative , which would have a significant impact on global resource management , land use and vegetation monitoring , was discussed .
It involved the development of the applications-oriented Earth remote sensing satellite RADARSAT , along with a synthetic aperture radar ( SAR ) system as its remote sensing payload .
In addition to the SAR all-weather , day and night recording capability of the Earth surface , RADARSAT would have a truly global monitoring capacity , as its on-board SAR data recorders would record and store data in a format compatible with most ground stations .
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) was currently starting to implement a new project , the Africa Land Cover Map and Digital Geographic Database ( AFRICOVER ) , for production of a digital geographic database and associated thematic map of land use and vegetation cover of the entire African continent .
The first phase of the AFRICOVER project was being implemented in East Africa .
The map of the entire continent would be produced at scales of 1 : 250,000 and 1 : 1,000,000 .
It was noted that the overall objective of AFRICOVER was to provide African decision makers , regional and international development agencies and United Nations organizations with reliable information on current land use and vegetation cover .
It was noted that the sector of environmental resource management was an activity that involved a well-defined user community .
That community required specific tools and data types for a wide variety of activities , from data acquisition to decision-making and control .
In that context , the GEOMANAGEMENT project was presented as an umbrella concept for typical management practices in the sector .
It was noted that the project would use geo-referenced data and information as the basis for its programmes .
GEOMANAGEMENT programmes and projects at international , national and local levels should be defined on the basis of a clear definition of priority issues .
Agenda 21 , the action plan adopted by the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , held at Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , from 3 to 14 June 1992,1 would serve as a basis for identifying national priorities in dealing with issues such as industrial pollution , waste management , land use and allocation , deforestation and the exploitation of renewable resources .
In that connection , activities that could improve the operational use of space technology were the establishment of local receiving stations , increased accessibility to environmental data and the stimulation of data sharing between international , regional and national organizations and agencies .
In 1993 , FAO and the United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) , in close cooperation with the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific ( ESCAP ) , initiated the Operational Low-Cost Integrated Vital Information Access ( OLIVIA ) programme , a long-term regional environmental programme aimed at the development and application of information technologies for natural resources and environmental management in the Asia and Pacific region .
The OLIVIA programme would support and strengthen cooperative decision-making relevant to sustainable environmental and natural resources management in agriculture , forestry and fisheries in the Asia and Pacific region , with particular emphasis on standardized and harmonized data and information exchange between interregional programmes .
In many developing countries , remote sensing and GIS were increasingly being used for mapping natural resources and hazard management .
A presentation by India on its remote sensing-based pilot project at the village level was made during the Symposium .
Applying cost-effective remote sensing techniques , land and water resources were identified in order to map the &quot; basic integrated land and water resource units &quot; in the Anantapur district , located in the south-west of the State of Andhra Pradesh .
Detailed mapping of natural resources on a scale of 1 : 50,000 had been undertaken , using data from the Information Retrieval Service ( IRS ) remote sensing satellite of India , known as IRS-1A .
The various scientific recommendations made on the basis of analyses of remote sensing data were validated in the field by several rural exercises .
On the basis of the encouraging results of the pilot study carried out in the Anantapur district , a nationwide project entitled &quot; Integrated mission for sustainable development &quot; had been launched in 172 districts spread over the whole country .
Those districts , frequently affected by droughts and floods and covering 45 per cent of the geographical area of India , were currently being extensively surveyed from outer space through the use of satellite remote sensing systems .
In the case of Malaysia , it was noted that the national meteorological agency , whose major role was to provide weather and meteorological services , was strongly supported by satellite remote sensing data .
It had been demonstrated that remote sensing from space platforms had contributed significantly to the advancement of meteorology , and in particular to a better understanding of tropical weather systems , as a means for improving weather-related disaster warning and response .
The Malaysian Meteorological Service operated a ground-based synoptic observation network to monitor weather , atmospheric and environmental conditions .
That organization depended heavily on space platform observations for the purpose of early warning of weather-related disasters such as floods and typhoons .
The dependency on space-based observing systems was a direct outcome of the excellent spatial coverage provided by those systems .
In Brazil , enormous amounts of biomass had been burned for fuel production and to clean the soil for cattle grazing and other agricultural uses .
Recent satellite images of the Amazon region had dramatically shown deforestation patterns , especially in the States of Para , Rond√¥nia and Maranh√£o .
Currently , the Brazilian Institute for Space Research ( INPE ) , with other national and international institutions , was studying the Amazon region using both ground-based and satellite remote sensing data .
The satellite systems that had been used included ERS-1 and ERS-2 , the Japanese Earth Resources Satellite ( JERS-1 ) , LANDSAT , the shuttle imaging radar ( SIR-C ) and the Experimental Earth Observation System ( SPOT ) .
In Zimbabwe , the Famine Early Warning System ( FEWS ) , a donor-supported programme , used the advanced very-high-resolution radiometer ( AVHRR ) satellite system to produce crop assessments during the growing season .
The FEWS programme provided only an indication , but not a sufficiently early indication , of drought and its sequences .
It was therefore essential for the FEWS programme to be reviewed and improved in order to make it more effective as a tool for the mitigation of droughts .
C. Space communications and disaster management
The spread of electronic telecommunications had surpassed the expectations of many experts .
In the United States , an estimated 9 million individuals telecommuted at least one or two days per week .
The nearly 18 million subscribers using cellular devices in the United States were a key part of the phenomena .
Many professionals such as attorneys and accountants extended their workday by some two hours via mobile communications .
A growing number of workers in countries and areas such as Barbados , India , Jamaica , Republic of Korea and Taiwan Province of China were telecommunicating to other countries such as the United States and Japan .
The wireless office for travelling professionals and mobile workers of all kinds seemed to be an almost inevitable trend , as the global economy increasingly shifted from agricultural and industrial employment to service-based employment dependent upon information and data rather than physical resources and specific locations .
Participants agreed that truly broad-band , high-quality and completely mobile services via satellite opened up a host of new possibilities and opportunities .
The participants noted some of those options which were becoming more accessible and cost-effective , including electronic tutors and telehealth units that could reach anywhere on Earth , flexible telecommunications services ( both mobile and fixed ) for home and business , wireless offices and extraterritorial networks .
In developing countries in particular , such options could be faster , more flexible and lower in cost .
The satellite communications industry had recently developed a concept using millimetre wave frequencies as a practical bandwidth for communications satellites .
For the first time , a proposal had been made for the use of low Earth orbit satellites to provide cost-effective and continuous services to rural and remote areas in parts of the developing world that lacked sufficient infrastructure .
ITU played a vital role in assisting developing countries in improving their communications infrastructure .
Special emphasis was placed on improving communications networks for remote and rural areas of developing countries through the use of satellite-based communications services .
Networks could develop incrementally without government involvement .
Furthermore , only a few local engineers would be needed to focus on limited tasks . Network extensions would be relatively low-cost , and could be funded by private sources .
There was no doubt that rural telecommunications could basically be profitable .
The main reason why so little money and time was invested seemed to be the high initial start-up cost and the expectation that a long time would be needed to reach the financial break-even point .
The cost of a conventional phone in a rural area during its first year was roughly $ 5,000 .
The average purchase price for a hand-held satellite phone was approximately $ 1,000 .
The lower initial investment could therefore significantly boost the availability of telecommunications in the rural areas of developing countries .
The impact would be increased by the fact that satellite phones could be easily redeployed , whereas conventional installations were more or less fixed .
In pursuing its mandate , ITU developed the Spacecom project to promote the use of satellite communications systems in rural and remote areas of developing countries .
The project was intended to provide industry with a realistic assessment of the requirements for satellite communications in rural and remote areas , to identify constraints , to propose viable solutions and to elaborate pilot projects .
It was organized so that the project sponsors ( mostly international organizations and industries from developed countries ) would constitute the decision-making body .
Regulatory and operating authorities in developing countries were invited to participate in the decision-making body , and ITU provided the implementation framework .
Given the typical characteristics of rural areas , such as sparseness of population , lack of trained personnel , low initial demand and high costs of installing individual services , it was suggested that the introduction of enhanced information exchange in rural areas of Africa should be achieved through the establishment of telecentres where services would be pooled to serve the entire community .
The telecentres would be located in a central village and offer a range of services depending on local needs .
The telecentres would contribute both directly and indirectly to economic , social , cultural and political development of rural areas by facilitating government administration and services , including those relevant to agriculture , rural education and health , development of economic activities and disaster mitigation efforts .
Several European countries recently agreed to jointly finance a satellite-based telecommunications system called MERCURE , for the benefit of the United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) .
In that context , a cooperative information network , known as the COPINE proposal , linking scientists , educators and professionals in Africa , was prepared by OOSA in close consultation with the secretariat of the MERCURE Governing Board .
Twelve countries had been targeted as implementation sites for the COPINE project : Botswana , Cameroon , Ethiopia , Ghana , Kenya , Morocco , Nigeria , Senegal , South Africa , Tunisia , United Republic of Tanzania and Zimbabwe .
They had been selected mainly on the basis of their needs and their perceived capacity to provide the necessary physical and governmental environment that would allow the project to be successfully implemented and sustained .
That implied , among other criteria , a recognition by the Governments concerned of the important role that modern information technologies could play in advancing national development , and other local developments relating to information exchange which could enhance the eventual usefulness of COPINE .
The priority application areas selected for networks using COPINE were discussed , including health care , management of natural resources and the environment , tele-education , and the exchange of scientific and technical information .
In general , COPINE would facilitate five types of data transmission : interactive audio , image and video transmissions ; large computer files on the order of 100 megabytes ; interactive data transfers such as on-line database searching ; scanned documents ; and voice communications .
In Mexico , a seismic alert system for Mexico City had been operating as an experimental evaluation project since 1991 .
The aim of the project was to mitigate the effects of earthquakes generated in the Guerrero Gap .
There was an average early-warning time advantage of 60 seconds before an earthquake occurring on the Guerrero Coast would strike Mexico City , some 320 kilometres away .
The system consisted of four parts : a seismic detection system , a dual telecommunications system , a central control system and a radio warning system for the public .
Civil government authorities , who sponsored the project , had made considerable efforts to increase earthquake preparedness .
One of the most important objectives of the civil government authorities was to achieve a high reliability level of the early-warning seismic system .
The real-time UHF / VHF radio communications system may therefore be complemented with satellite communications systems , enhancing communications between field stations and the public , and also increasing the geographical coverage of Mexico .
II . OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
During the course of the Symposium participants re-emphasized the vital role of space technology in improving human conditions in developing countries .
To make progress in further benefiting from such potential , solutions had to be found to several policy issues and their related technical challenges .
Participants noted that one of the most important solutions was the continued availability of satellite systems in support of social , economic and environmental development .
Participants emphasized the importance of demonstrating the cost-effectiveness of using space technology for the implementation of high-priority projects identified by Governments in national programmes for sustainable development .
Assuming that its cost-effectiveness was assured , bilateral and multilateral development and funding agencies as well as international organizations should increasingly incorporate the use of space technology in the design and formulation of development projects at national and regional levels .
Regional and international organizations dealing with social and economic development issues should increase their cooperation in order to assist developing countries in incorporating space applications into their national programmes .
The organizations specifically targeted included the Asian Development Bank , the Commission of the European Communities , ESA , UNEP , United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) , FAO , World Health Organization ( WHO ) , World Bank and WMO .
Participants reiterated that remote sensing and GIS technologies would play a vital role in filling the information gap in developing countries with regard to the current state of their natural resources , land use and impact of natural disasters .
It was emphasized that some developing countries would need short-term assistance in the provision of such information to their decision makers when needed , and long-term assistance in strengthening their national capacities to be able to generate such information in an effective and timely manner .
Participants agreed that efforts should be undertaken to promote the use of space technology through the mass media , thus emphasizing the achievements of space technology and its applications , in an easily comprehensible manner at different educational levels using newly available equipment such as personal computers , CD-ROMs or other inexpensive ground receiving stations .
Furthermore , space technology curricula relating to national programmes for sustainable development in developing countries should be introduced through universities .
Developed countries should continue to assist developing countries in implementing space technology for national development plans and programmes .
In that context , it was stressed that the establishment of regional and national education and training centres for space technology would play a vital role .
Industry participation and sufficient infrastructure were also mentioned as areas of vital importance in the successful incorporation of space projects into national programmes .
If no proper policy was implemented , then the role of industry would be restricted to that of short-term contractors rather than equal partners in space applications .
In India , an infrastructure of 400 local industries as partners in the Indian national space programme had been created , on the assumption that industrial competitiveness provided the assurance of high-quality service .
In that context , participants discussed the possibility of other developing countries following the example of India in developing an industrial infrastructure contributing to national space programmes .
However , it was stated that in most developing countries , private sector involvement in space technology applications was still negligible .
National organizations and agencies should therefore seek ways and means of introducing space technology for sustainable development into the private sector .
Furthermore , non-governmental organizations should be involved in the application of space technology to various economic sectors where savings could be made .
Every country intending to profit from space technology should appoint some form of national focal point to act as a coordinator and disseminator of information both within the country concerned and within other countries and international organizations and agencies .
It was deemed to be a priority task to demonstrate to national decision makers that providing funds to space applications for sustainable development would pay off .
Specialists from developing countries stressed the need for increased standardization of satellite data , and the Committee of Earth Observation Satellites was urged to continue to give attention to that matter .
Satellite remote sensing capabilities were increasingly being built into environmental monitoring units within ministries for environmental protection .
While that was a significant improvement regarding the use of satellite remote sensing as a tool for policy- and decision-making , ministries in many developing countries were still constrained by the lack of funds and of executive responsibility .
In that context , the need for improved access to inexpensive remote sensing data in a standardized format on a continuous basis was stressed .
Remote sensing technologies had been developed mainly in developed countries .
Developing countries had sought to incorporate those technologies into their development plans and programmes , yet most developing countries were still not prepared to implement remote sensing programmes because of the high cost of remote sensing data , limited manpower and funding resources and a lack of organizational structures .
Participants repeatedly emphasized that remote sensing and GIS were valuable tools for resource managers and policy makers concerned with the preservation of the environment and national development plans .
Despite technological advances , decreasing costs and increasing &quot; user-friendliness &quot; , the potential offered by those technologies had not yet been fully assessed or realized .
Further investigations were therefore needed to assess the costs and benefits associated with remote sensing applications .
Sufficient training and education possibilities were critical for successfully incorporating remote sensing and GIS technologies into national development plans .
Training was required at a variety of levels and in a number of forms , from one-day to one-week seminars for senior resource management personnel to two-week to three-month training classes for advanced technical personnel , to university degree training at undergraduate and graduate levels .
Given the importance of training , it was noted that a number of regional and international organizations and agencies offered various training programmes .
Despite those efforts , however , the lack of trained personnel in developing countries continued to be a critical constraint on the full exploitation of remote sensing and GIS for developmental purposes .
The relationship between access to information and level of income was already strong and becoming stronger both within and among countries .
The information revolution threatened to increase inequities , but it also provided tools to reduce poverty .
Improved access to education , health care and environmental information was increasingly available to developing countries because of recent developments in information technology .
Rural and poor urban communities could be integrated into economic life , and thereby raise their income levels through information services .
The end-user should be the focal point of all serious attempts to develop successful new satellite communications services .
Planners should tailor the range and mobility of the service requirements to respond to those challenges , and map technologies to meet the needs of the end-user .
In the future , the design , development and deployment of user-friendly satellites should be given the highest priority in the design and deployment of national , regional and international information infrastructures .
In developing new applications software and customer-specific systems for health , education , training , telecommuting and further relevant social services , the United Nations and its Member States should strengthen their leadership role .
An entity such as ISU , for example , could be petitioned to compile a global database of all satellite and fibre optic systems currently in operation .
Once created , such a database could be interactively assessed by worldwide health and education organizations to determine how those systems could be made available for low cost tele-education , telehealth and telemedicine services .
There had been several recent successful efforts among international funding agencies to study possible applications of telecommunications technology and to implement projects in developing countries .
The University of the West Indies Distance Teaching Experiment , the Indonesian Distance Education Satellite System , and the Peruvian Rural Communications Services Project currently included 25 conference sites and reached thousands of university students , teachers , doctors , nurses , health-care workers and researchers .
With the improved skills , greater knowledge and up-to-date information afforded by those programmes , the recipients of training were better able to support national development plans .
Moreover , the programmes could be used as models for future training efforts .

INTRODUCTION
It was co-sponsored by the Swedish Board for Investment and Technical Support ( BITS ) on behalf of the Government of Sweden , and hosted by the Department of Physical Geography of Stockholm University and by the Swedish Space Corporation ( SSC Satellitbild ) .
The course was conducted specifically for the benefit of university educators from developing countries with the objective of enabling them to introduce elements of remote sensing technology into the curricula of their academic institutions .
The present report describes the organization of the training course , its technical contents , and the projects undertaken by the participants during the course .
The choice of projects reflected both the academic interests of the participants and current national development issues in their countries of origin .
The report presents the results of the course evaluation and the proposed follow-up plan of action .
It was prepared for the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and its Scientific and Technical Subcommittee .
Application forms and information brochures on the training course were sent out in early December 1994 by the Office for Outer Space Affairs of the United Nations to offices of the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) for transmission to the relevant national authorities .
The same materials were also sent out simultaneously by Stockholm University to the embassies of Sweden in 75 countries and to previous participants in the course for local distribution .
The target group comprising 75 countries whose development needs reflected the priorities of Sweden was selected by BITS .
Over 110 completed applications were subsequently received and jointly processed by the Office for Outer Space Affairs of the United Nations and Stockholm University .
The training course was attended by 25 participants , three of whom were female .
Participants came from the following countries : Egypt , Ethiopia , Kenya , Nepal , Nigeria , Pakistan , Senegal , Sri Lanka , Swaziland , Uganda , United Republic of Tanzania , Viet Nam and Zimbabwe .
Instructors came from the Office for Outer Space Affairs , BITS , the European Space Agency , SSC Satellitbild , Stockholm University , the Swedish National Space Board , the Swedish Royal Institute of Technology , the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation and Uppsala University .
Funds for the international travel of 12 participants from developing countries were provided by the United Nations .
All other support , including air travel for 13 participants , room and board , course materials and inland transport for all 25 participants was provided by the Government of Sweden .
Addresses were given at the opening ceremony by the President of Stockholm University and by the representative of the Office for Outer Space Affairs .
The representative of BITS presented an overview of Swedish aid policy , and gave some insight into the ongoing restructuring of Swedish aid organizations .
The restructuring had been completed and the BITS replaced by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency ( SIDA ) .
The programme of the training course ( see annex I ) was prepared by the Department of Physical Geography of Stockholm University in consultation with the Office for Outer Space Affairs .
The course consisted of a series of lectures and laboratory and field exercises .
Technical visits were made to a number of sites of interest , including the ESA / Salmijarvi and Esrange satellite receiving stations , and the Kirunavaara underground mine .
Six days of the course were spent at Satellitbild , the Swedish Space Corporation facility for data processing and map production at Kiruna .
The participants were allowed three and a half days for the visual interpretation of remote sensing images of regions of their countries which they had selected .
Among the highlights of the course were the presentations made by participants on the results of their visual interpretation projects .
A description of the projects is presented in annex II .
A summary presentation of the topics introduced during the training course is given in section I below .
This presentation selectively describes basic aspects of satellite remote sensing and geographic information systems ( GIS ) which must be sufficiently appreciated by users of remotely sensed data for their effective application to the national development problems or academic issues identified by the participants .
An analysis of the course evaluation as well as the plan for follow-up action are presented in sections II and III , respectively .
Data from several different satellites ( for example , European Remote Sensing Satellite ( ERS ) , Land Remote Sensing Satellite ( Landsat ) , Syst√®me pour l &apos;observation de la Terre ( SPOT ) , Resurs , Japanese Earth Resource Satellite ( JERS ) , Indian Remote Sensing Satellite ( IRS ) and Meteosat ) were useful in the analysis of problems related to national development , especially those pertaining to the assessment of natural resources and monitoring of the environment .
For the training course , which stressed visual interpretation of Earth observation data over terrestrial surfaces , data from Landsat and SPOT satellites were emphasized .
Requests for satellite imagery and associated products could be made to a number of vendors , including Satellitbild .
Users could also directly access metadata , in other words , information on the availability and quality of satellite images , and even preview samples of images .
The metadata were increasingly being made available as databases on CD-ROM ( for example , the Ocean Color European Archive Network ( OCEAN ) image-base consultation system , the advanced very high resolution radiometer ( AVHRR ) CD browser known as Ionia ) .
Some databases could also be accessed via Internet .
A number of important criteria , such as cloud cover , date and frequency of image acquisition and spectral and spatial characteristics , must be borne in mind when ordering satellite remote sensing images .
While , for example , the overall percentage of cloud cover in a given image might be acceptably low , the clouds that were present might obscure the specific geographical zone of interest .
It was therefore desirable to preview images prior to purchase .
The date of image acquisition had a direct bearing on the various uses to which it could eventually be put .
For example , whereas wet season images would be useful for determining vegetative cover , they were less useful for mapping landforms and soils .
The revisit capability of the satellite also played a role in the potential applications of the images collected .
While a given geographical area of interest might be imaged by the AVHRR instrument on a daily basis , the Landsat TM and SPOT series of satellites offered revisit capabilities of 16 and 26 days , respectively .
In the case of SPOT imagery , the revisit capability could be reduced to 1 or 4 days using the off-nadir viewing capability of that sensor to facilitate the monitoring of short-lived phenomena , such as certain categories of natural disaster .
The appearance of remotely sensed images was determined by several factors , including sensor , atmospheric and terrain characteristics .
Multispectral data , such as those acquired by the IRS , Landsat , Meteosat and SPOT series of satellites , were collected in multiple spectral bands .
The optical , multispectral scanners sensed the solar energy reflected or emitted by surface features .
By contrast , radar satellites , such as the ERS-1 and 2 , JERS and Radarsat , exploited the microwave region of the spectrum .
Those satellites carried instruments that transmitted microwave energy in pulses and measured the travel time of the back-scattered microwave signal .
The multispectral scanners were normally used to acquire images during daylight hours .
While the data from those scanners might be affected by local atmospheric conditions ( for example , clouds that blocked observation of surface features ) , the acquisition of images from radar satellites was not similarly constrained .
In general , the multispectral and radar instruments exploited different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum , and could often yield complementary information useful for tackling a variety of national development problems .
Apart from a consideration of the radiometric characteristics ( i.e. number and type of spectral bands ) of a given sensor relative to the spectral characteristics of the features of interest , the type of satellite imagery that would be useful for a given application was dependent on the level of detail required .
The ground spatial resolution of imagery was often a determining factor in its application , since it was indicative of the smallest distinguishable surface feature .
In the case of Meteosat visible channels , for example , the ground spatial resolution was nominally 2.5 kilometres , whereas for SPOT multispectral imagery , it was 20 metres .
That level of spatial resolution rendered SPOT multispectral imagery useful for preparing maps up to a suggested maximum scale of approximately 1 : 50,000 .
The raw images collected by optical sensors on board the satellites were corrected for radiometric and geometric distortions , in order to facilitate subsequent visual image interpretation or computer classification and to assure that they could be superposed on pre-existing maps as required , for example , in a GIS .
In response to user needs and capabilities , vendors of satellite remote sensing data usually offered several different value-added image products , each reflecting different levels of processing and correction ( e.g. system- or precision-corrected images ) .
System-corrected images were those which had been corrected for predictable distortions in the image because of factors such as Earth rotation during the imaging .
In precision-corrected images , geometric corrections were made using mathematical transformations based on several common locations ( ground control points ) identified within both the unrectified image and a corresponding planimetric map of an appropriate scale ( e.g. 1 : 50,000 for Landsat images ) .
Alternatively , the required transformation could be developed using the locations of ground control points determined by a global positioning system ( GPS ) instrument .
In order to facilitate comparisons between images acquired at different dates and under different conditions , radiometric corrections , which accounted for variations in scene illumination , viewing geometry and instrument-response characteristics , could be undertaken .
The end-user might request satellite data in digital format or as photographic prints .
There were several different types of image enhancement ( processing steps which rendered the images easier to interpret ) which could be performed on the raw digital data to maximize their usefulness for a specific application .
Many different types of enhancement were possible , including contrast stretching , filtering , formation of band ratios , intensity-hue-saturation transformations and the formation of colour composites .
Photographic prints could be ordered from vendors with specific enhancements already made to satisfy the requirements of a chosen application .
However , access to the data in digital format gave the user the added flexibility to carry out , at his or her convenience and as the need arose , local or global image enhancements or classifications appropriate for a range of applications .
Having the data in digital format also facilitated eventual incorporation of remotely sensed information into a GIS .
Digital image processing , however , required access to related equipment ( e.g. a computer and large-format printer ) and software which might be lacking in some academic departments .
Visual interpretation of enhanced prints made from digital images was , on the other hand , less costly .
The field verification of thematic maps prepared from interpreted images was an important step in assuring the reliability of information derived from remotely sensed images .
The traditional magnetic compass served as an invaluable and simple tool for establishing the correspondence between locations in an image and those in the field .
However , the use of GPS instruments for that purpose was gaining in popularity owing to their simplicity of use , reasonable cost and high levels of precision .
Surface features in images could be digitally classified using a range of supervised and unsupervised approaches .
The supervised approach required that the operator should have some knowledge of a few locations within the image of the classes ( e.g. soil , water or type of vegetation ) being mapped .
Such information was used to guide the subsequent computer classification process . By contrast , in an unsupervised classification , the resulting classes were determined by analysis of the statistics of the multispectral images being analysed .
For visual classification , multispectral images were enhanced to emphasize features of interest ( e.g. shallow water as opposed to land features ) prior to printing and subsequent interpretation .
The analyst used photographic interpretation elements ( e.g. tone , texture , shape , drainage , landforms , topography , and lineaments ) to facilitate visual classification .
In visual interpretation , the geographical limits of the various classes were traced onto the print .
Those traces could subsequently be input to a GIS in the form of a vector map through digitization .
The vector map might be converted to raster format to suit analytical needs .
It was widely acknowledged that remotely sensed data were useful for a large range of applications .
That was reflected in the variety of projects undertaken by the participants ( see table in annex II ) , which included applications to terrestrial as well as marine environments .
The terrestrial applications related mainly to agriculture ( soil erosion , deforestation , land-use planning and siltation ) , geology and hydrogeology ( river-bank erosion , groundwater management ) , the mitigation of natural hazards ( landslides , glacial lake outbursts , snow avalanches , debris flows , floods etc . ) , meteorology , pollution and urbanization .
The sole marine application focused on problems induced by the presence of algal blooms .
C. GIS data integration and map preparation
A GIS consisted of hardware , software and data components which allowed the efficient storage , analysis and presentation of information .
The data in a GIS were georeferenced ( i.e. they referred to precise , real-world geographic coordinates ) with the result that different thematic maps of the same area could be exactly superposed .
To achieve that , the different maps must all have similar levels of generalization ( i.e. similar original map scales of preparation ) and similar geometric projection .
In general , the data within a GIS were of four generic types , namely , points , lines , tables and areas .
The areas might be polygonal , vectorial or raster in nature .
Several different operations ( e.g. overlay , neighbourhood analysis , interpolation , classification and time-series analysis ) could be performed on those four types of data during the course of spatial analysis prompted by a query .
Data within a GIS could be queried to respond to questions that only required the retrieval of data .
That did not involve any manipulation between layers of data .
Alternatively , the queries might involve simple to complex manipulation of several layers according to various rules or models ( e.g. process , mathematical , heuristic , expert systems etc . ) .
GIS could also be used in simulation studies ( e.g. to determine the effects of land-use changes on run-off and flooding risks , or the effect of water availability on crop yields ) .
The capacity to respond rapidly and interactively to questions made GIS invaluable as a decision-making tool , since many &quot; what if &quot; scenarios could be examined prior to the implementation of a final decision .
For example , a relatively simple query that was readily amenable to processing by a GIS was the following : &quot; Where are the locations suitable for agriculture under rain-fed conditions which are amenable to the use of mechanized agriculture equipment and which are within 10 km of major roadways or railway lines or navigable rivers ? &quot;
To respond to that query , the needed data must include soils , rainfall , surface slope and road , rail and river networks .
A major requirement in the establishment of a GIS was to assemble a database that would be useful for tackling the range of problems to be addressed .
That could be a bottleneck to the implementation of a GIS , since unless the data already existed in digital format , they must be so converted , often by costly manual techniques ( e.g. manual digitizing ) .
Sharing data might help to quickly develop a GIS database .
However , issues such as data exchange standards must be addressed in order to avoid problems of inaccurate data .
In general , the acquisition and input of useful data constituted one of the most critical and often costly aspects of setting up a GIS system .
Apart from its analytical capabilities , a GIS system was often used in cartographic applications to prepare paper-based maps displaying selected spatial elements from one or more digital sources as well as the results of a complex spatial analysis .
Such a GIS capability allowed maps to be tailor-made according to their proposed end-uses , as the need arose .
A knowledge of cartographic concepts , including those relating to geodetic datum , reference ellipsoid , map projection and global positioning system was necessary to fully exploit that capability .
D. Curriculum development
Conditions which influenced the implementation of a new course varied considerably between academic institutions , even those located within the same country .
A structured approach to programme formulation which took into account the specific constraints imposed on and opportunities available at a given institution was therefore necessary .
II . COURSE EVALUATION
The responses on the completed course evaluation forms were analysed by a small committee of participants whose members were selected by the participants themselves .
Formal presentation of the results of the analysis was made on the last day of the course by a member of the committee to all participants and representatives of BITS , the Department of Geography of Stockholm University and the United Nations .
Discussions following the formal presentation allowed additional inputs to be made by all participants .
The key results of the analysis of responses were that :
( a ) All participants would have liked more time to be devoted to practical exercises in remote sensing and GIS ;
( b ) Approximately 80 per cent agreed that the course was well conceived ;
( c ) Approximately 70 per cent felt that they had benefited significantly from the course ;
( d ) Approximately 90 per cent agreed with the duration of the course .
Some participants anticipated difficulties in applying the newly acquired knowledge in their current employment .
Those difficulties , linked essentially to a lack of adequate funds , included access to remotely sensed data and to computers and software for GIS and image processing .
III . PROPOSED FOLLOW-UP PLAN OF ACTION
In light of the results of the course evaluation indicating strong interest by participants in having greater exposure to digital image-processing techniques , the Office for Outer Space Affairs proposed to examine the possibility of organizing , through SIDA , a more advanced course for remote sensing educators , during which operational computer techniques in the application of remotely sensed data would be emphasized .
Such a course would require participants to be already competent in the visual techniques of image interpretation , and might therefore include graduates of the current course .
It was envisaged that the proposed course would alternate with the current introductory course during successive years . Annex I PROGRAMME OF THE COURSE

In its resolution 49 / 34 , paragraph 32 , of 9 December 1994 , the General Assembly considered it essential that Member States pay more attention to the problem of collisions of space objects , including nuclear power sources , with space debris , and other aspects of space debris , and called for the continuation of national research on that question , for the development of improved technology for the monitoring of space debris and for the compilation and dissemination of data on space debris .
To the extent possible , the Assembly noted , information thereon should be provided to the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space . .
The General Assembly , in paragraph 17 of the same resolution , invited Member States to report to the Secretary-General on a regular basis with regard to national and international research concerning the safety of nuclear-powered satellites .
. The Secretary-General addressed a note verbale dated 4 August 1995 to all Member States , inviting them to communicate to the Secretariat , by 31 October 1995 , the information requested above so that the Secretariat could prepare a report containing that information for submission to the Subcommittee at its thirty-third session .
. The present document was prepared by the Secretariat on the basis of information received from Member States as of 31 October 1995 .
Information received subsequent to this date will be included in addenda to the present document .
&#91; Original : English &#93;
The Canadian Space Agency is pleased to report the following with respect to the acquisition and understanding of data on the characteristics of the space debris environment and mitigation techniques :
‚àô MELEO : The Materials Exposure in Low Earth Orbit ( MELEO ) was an active experiment flown on Shuttle mission STS-52 in October 1992 .
The experiment was primarily designed to measure the effect of the environment on material specimens ( 313 in total ) which were mounted on the CANADARM ( Canadian robotic arm on the U.S. Shuttle ) and exposed in the &quot; ram &quot; direction during the mission for a total of approximately 30 hours .
The experiment also included two active quartz crystal microbalances which were designed to operate in reverse fashion to measure the atomic oxygen fluence during exposure .
The experiment was developed by a number of co-investigators several of whom included materials designed to capture small orbital debris particles and micrometeorites .
During the mission , a solid rocket motor was used to raise a satellite payload to a high orbit after deployment from the Shuttle .
It was this event that provided the majority of data on orbital debris during the mission .
Although the material specimens were protected during the firing itself , many of the specimens which were returned to Earth for evaluation had been impacted by many small particles .
The estimated particle size was consistent with the expected effluent from the solid rocket although the duration of persistence of the debris cloud was not expected .
As a result , this experiment provided data on the orbital debris caused by the burning of a solid rocket motor .
‚àô ACOMEX : The Advanced Composite Material Exposure Experiment ( ACOMEX ) was also a Shuttle-based experiment flown on STS-41G in October 1994 .
The purpose of this experiment was to gather data on the degradation of composite materials in low Earth orbit .
The experiment consisted of a number of material specimens mounted on the CANADARM which was positioned in the &quot; ram &quot; direction for approximately 40 hours during the mission .
This experiment was not designed to measure orbital debris but examination of the material specimens which were returned to Earth after the mission provided some observations which were identified as likely a result of impacts in space .
Although no detailed data resulted , this experiment did contribute to the design of the MELEO experiment noted above .
‚àô LDEF : One of the experiments aboard the Long Duration Exposure Facility was provided by Canadian Investigators from the University of Toronto .
Much has been published to date on the results from the LDEF spacecraft , which includes the results obtained from this Canadian experiment .
After return to Earth this experiment was thoroughly examined to identify impact sites .
Over 70 impact sites were clearly identified .
In addition , the data from the entire spacecraft as reported through the Orbital Debris Special Investigation Group was analysed and presented in the form of an Engineering Monogram that could be used for design of spacecraft .
Furthermore , ground testing has been used to correlate the size and type of damage experimented in the specimens with probable particle size and velocity .
‚àô The Institute for Space and Terrestrial Science ( ISTS ) and the University of Western Ontario are studying the space debris monitoring potential for large diameter , non-steerable , ground-based telescopes based on the liquid mirror concept developed at Universit√© de Laval .
‚àô MBP Technologies of Pointe-Claire , Quebec , is conducting a study of possible electro-optical and infrared sensors for space surveillance , particularly space-based sensors and systems ; the interest is in application of millimetre-wave radar technology to observation , tracking and identification of debris .
‚àô Based on impact data recorded from LDEF , the University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies ( UTIAS ) develops design monograms for predicting the number of impacts on a spacecraft as a function of altitude , inclination , time in orbit and orientation .
‚àô The University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies ( UTIAS ) is developing protective technologies to mitigate damage caused by orbital debris .
Furthermore , it is working on flight test experiments to be performed on the exterior of space stations .

Chile reports that at present it is not conducting any research relating to space debris and that it does not have satellites that operate with nuclear energy .
Consequently , studies are not being conducted on possible collisions of nuclear-power sources with space debris . Japan
RECENT SPACE DEBRIS ACTIVITIES IN JAPAN
Space debris is intrinsically a global problem that all space-faring nations must solve in cooperation in order to preserve a safe environment for future space activities .
One of the world &apos;s earliest warnings on this issue was made in Japan in 1971 by M. Nagatomo and his colleagues of the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science ( ISAS ) .M. Nagatomo , H. Matsuo and K. Uesugi , &quot; Some considerations on utilization control of the near Earth space in future &quot; , Proc . 9th ISTS , Tokyo , pp. 257-263 ( 1971 ) .
Since that time , independent research on this topic has been carried out by various organizations in Japan .
However , any systematic or organized activities were not performed until 1990 when the Japan Society for Aeronautical and Space Sciences ( JSASS ) founded the Space debris Study Group .
The study group consisted of over 30 members from space-related organizations and industries and issued an interim report in January 1992 and a final report in March 1993.S. Toda and T. Yasakka , &quot; Space debris studies in Japan &quot; , Adv .
Some of the recommendations presented in the report have been followed up by the two newly formed JSASS Study Groups .
As a result of the continuing efforts by the JSASS Study Groups , Japanese space related agencies and organizations have now recognized that the space debris hazard is no longer an abstract problem , but rather a real and serious threat to manned and unmanned activities in space .
The Japanese Government Space Activities Commission ( SAC ) has expressed Japan &apos;s policy on space debris in the report on Japan &apos;s Space Long Term Vision which was published in July 1994 : Toward Creation of Space Age in the New Century ( Report on Japan &apos;s Space Long-Term Vision ) by Special Committee on Long-Term Vision , Space Activities Commission ( July 1994 ) .
&quot; Japan will aim to develop such systems that will leave as little space debris as possible .
With regard to existing space debris , we will cooperate with other countries in considering ways of reducing it . &quot;
The National Space Development Agency of Japan ( NASDA ) , which is responsible for implementing practical applications of space developments in Japan , founded its own working group in August 1993 to study space debris problems and to establish the NASDA policy and debris mitigation and protection standards .
In this article , the recent and planned activities in the space debris field in Japan are briefly reviewed .
I. SPACE DEBRIS MEASUREMENT
A. Optical observation
Optical observations of geo-stationary objects have been made by the Communication Research Laboratory ( CRL ) utilizing an optical observation system in Koganei , Tokyo ( 35.42 ¬∞ N , 139.29 ¬∞ E ) .
It consists of a 1.5 m aperture telescope , a peltier cooled CCD camera with a chip size of 1242 x 1152 pixels , an image processing computer and other scientific and communication equipment .
The system was originally built as a fixed ground station for space communication experiments using a geostationary satellite .
With this CRL optical observation system , objects as small as 20 cm at geostationary altitude are theoretically observable .
Therefore , it is expected to contribute to an international cooperative project to measure the debris population in and around Geostationary Orbit ( GEO ) .
As a collaborative study with NASDA , the National Astronomical Observatory in Japan ( NAO ) has been conducting observations of the GEO satellites since 1992 , using the Schmit telescopes of the Kagoshima Space Center ( KSC ) of ISAS ( 31.13 ¬∞ N , 131.04 ¬∞ E ) and the Kiso Observatory of the University of Tokyo ( 35.48 ¬∞ N , 137.38 ¬∞ E ) .
The use of other telescopes in Japan has also been found to be promising .
For more detailed and long-lasting observations , however , a dedicated debris observation system will be required .
JSASS and NASDA will start the preliminary joint studies on a GEO satellite to detect space debris in GEO in July 1995 .
B. Radar observation
Space debris monitoring by a bistatic radar system has been studied by T. Takano and his group at ISAS .
They have successfully demonstrated the applicability of this system in the observation experiment of &quot; Yokoh &quot; which is a scientific satellite with a mass of 420 kg in a circular orbit of 600 km altitude and at an inclination of 31.3 ¬∞ .
In the experiment , they used the 20 m diameter antenna at KSC as a transmission station and the 64 m diameter antenna at the Usuda Deep Space Center ( UDSC ) of ISAS ( 36.13 ¬∞ N , 138.37 ¬∞ E ) as a reception station .
The distance between the two stations is about 1,000 km .
By means of modern communication technology , objects as small as 2 cm at 500 km altitude are detected .
The laser radar system for detecting space debris has been investigated by an ISAS group led by T. Yokota .
The system is composed of a Nd : Yag laser , a light beam expander , a telescope , a CCD camera , a photo multiplier and a computer .
It is estimated to have the capability to detect a particle 1 mm in diameter at a distance of 1 km .
Therefore , it can be used as an on-board space debris observation system for detecting small-size debris and for collision avoidance manoeuvres .
They have developed an engineering model of the system and are testing its basic performance .
Radar has been the most effective means of observing LEO ( low Earth orbit ) debris of &quot; threatening size , &quot; which is debris pieces larger than about 1 cm .
All existing databases and statistics of such space debris , including the famous USSPACECOM catalogue , depend largely on observations with various radars .
They usually contain an important item &quot; size , &quot; which is determined from the strength of the received echo .
In evaluating the impact of a collision of debris with a shielding wall , for example , it is common to interpret it as the diameter of a sphere .
The size of the target is computed from the radar cross section ( RCS ) , which is defined as the area of an isotropic scatterer whose echo power is the same as the given target . It indeed agrees with the physical cross section for large metallic spheres , but often differs largely for objects with irregular shapes , especially when observed at a high frequency band .
For example , a piece of thin wire may be misinterpreted as a cannon-ball .
For objects smaller than the radar wavelength , RCS is inversely proportional to the 4th power of the wavelength ( or to the 4th power of the frequency ) .
Most radars used for space debris monitoring thus employ a frequency of 5-10 GHz , or even higher , in order to obtain a high sensitivity for small debris .
At such a high frequency , the RCS varies drastically as the orientation of the target relative to the radar changes .
It is then hard to estimate the real cross section from the observed RCS .
At a lower frequency , on the other hand , the relation between the physical cross section and the RCS becomes much simpler , although we have to pay an expensive cost in the sensitivity reduction for small targets .
The MU ( Middle and Upper atmosphere ) radar of Kyoto University , Japan , is a powerful VHF radar operating at 46.5 MHz ; its 1 MW output power and the 100 m antenna compensate for the reduced sensitivity at this frequency .
The main target of this radar is Earth &apos;s atmosphere , or more precisely , weak backscattering from irregularities in the refractive index of the air caused by the atmospheric turbulence .
Since this atmospheric echo is so weak , scientists have been bothered by contamination of strong &quot; undesired &quot; echoes from various objects such as space debris .
We decided to make use of these previously discarded echoes and started a statistical study of space debris in 1988 .
The antenna of the MU radar consists of 475 Yagi antennas constituting an active phased array .
The advantage of this type of antenna is that it can observe different directions almost simultaneously by electronically switching multiple antenna beams .
Figure 1 shows an example of debris observation using eight antenna beams switched sequentially from pulse to pulse around the zenith.T. Sato , T. Wakayama , T. Tanaka , K. Ikeda and I. Kimura , &quot; Shape of space debris as estimated from RCS variations &quot; , J. Spacecraft , 31 , 665-670 ( 1994 ) .
The target , which turned out to be the Kosmos 1023 rocket booster , passed through these beams , and the variation of RCS was tracked for about 20 sec .
It is also possible to roughly determine the orbit of the target from a single observation .
Conventional radars with a large parabola antenna cannot continuously observe an orbital object for more than a fraction of a second unless its orbit is given beforehand .
The large and smooth variation of RCS versus time ( shown in the lower-right panel of figure 1 ) indicates the rotation of the rocket booster .
The maximum value roughly agrees with its maximum physical cross section .
The most direct way to &quot; see &quot; the shape of a target using radar is to make the antenna beam sharp enough so that it can resolve the target .
It is , however , impractical to get a resolution of 1 m at a distance of 100 km because the necessary diameter of the antenna is in the order of 10 km .
A more sensible technique is to make use of the rotation of the target .
The idea is to resolve a different part of a target moving at a different velocity relative to the radar by measuring the Doppler velocity spectra .
This method is called ISAR ( Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar ) , or RDI ( Range-Doppler Interferometry ) , and has been widely used in military radars and in radar astronomy .
It was already applied to space debris by using German FGAN radar , which revealed a clear image of a Salyut-Kosmos complex.D. Mehrholz , &quot; Radar tracking and observation of noncooperative space objects by reentry of Salyut-7 / Kosmos-1686 &quot; , Proc .
At the moment , the resolution is limited to about 1 m so it cannot be used to identify the shape of small targets 1-10 cm in size , which is of the greatest concern .
Figure 1 .
The angular motion ( left ) , the height variation ( upper right ) , and the RCS variation ( lower right ) of Kosmos-0123 rocket booster as observed
The circles in the upper left panel show the coverage of the antenna beams .
Some statistical information on the shape of space debris is obtained by comparing the physical cross section estimated from the atmospheric drug with RCS , as shown above .
The major limitation of this technique is that the same object has to be monitored for a long duration in order to detect orbital decay .
The results of our MU radar observations also provide similar information .
Numerical simulations showed that the magnitude of RCS variation can be interpreted in terms of the prolateness of the object .
Since a single observation gives the variation seen from one direction , we need to interpret many observations in a statistical manner .
The result of such analysis indicates that the volume of relatively small debris observed with the MU radar is less than half of the sphere which has the same RCS .
In order to evaluate the actual size of space debris , shape information must be obtained .
Although the first priority in designing a future debris radar is that it should have a sensitivity to detect objects of 1-10 cm , it also should have the capability to track an unknown object continuously for at least 10 sec , which is necessary to carry out both ISAR ( RDI ) analysis and / or the statistical analysis shown above .
The phased array antenna is the essential element in realizing this capability . C. Impact measurements
Based on the one-year intensive study , the JSASS Study Group on Space Debris and Micrometeoroid Impact Detection has proposed the post flight analysis ( PFA ) of the Space Flyer Unit ( SFU ) to the Institute for Unmanned Space Experiment Free Flyer ( USEF ) .
SFU is a Sun-pointing , 3-axis stabilized , unmanned platform facility .
It was launched on 15 March 1995 by the H-II third flight and is scheduled to be retrieved by the Shuttle STS-72 in January 1996 .
It will stay in a circular orbit at an altitude of 300-500 km and at an inclination of 28.5 ¬∞ and will become the first Japanese space structure to be returned to Earth .
The total area of the exposed surfaces of SFU is about 150 m ¬≤ and the four main large surfaces are the planned targets for PFA :
‚óè Payload Unit Multi-Layer Insulation ( MLI ) , which is an octagonal structure 4.46 m in diameter and 1.40 m in height ;
‚óè Exposed Facility Flyer Unit ( EFFU ) , which is a box-like structure with a top surface that measures 1.48 m x 1.48 m and is covered with silver-coated Teflon for a radiator and with four side plates 1.05 m in height that are covered with aluminized Kapton MLI ;
‚óè Solar Array Paddle with a length of 24.4 m and a width of 2.36 m ; and
‚óè Two-Dimensional Deployable High Voltage Solar Array , which is a triangle sail with a height of 3.84 m and a base length of 3.62 m in the full deployed configuration .
It is expected that much information will be obtained through comparison with LDEF , EURECA and HST solar array PFA data .
The Japanese Experimental Module Flight Demonstration ( JFD ) is planned on board the Space Shuttle as a verification test of the manipulator system for the Japanese Experimental Module ( JEM ) of the International Space Station Alpha ( ISSA ) .
Utilizing this opportunity , the Parts and Material Laboratory of NASDA is planning to perform the Experiment of Space Environment with Materials ( ESEM ) .
The ESEM system consists of Dust of Space debris collectors ( DC ) and material sample holders ( MSH ) for evaluation of the atomic oxygen effect in space .
They will be mounted on the top of the JFD experiment apparatus in the Shuttle payload bay and will be exposed to the Shuttle flight direction for 40 hours .
This program is slated for April 1997 .
II . SPACE DEBRIS MITIGATION
Among the different types of orbital objects , the largest number is that of fragment debris created by explosions .
These are the result of rocket upper stage explosions , intentional distractions and other unknown factors .
The nature of the latter is not quite clear , but is believed to include explosions caused by hypervelocity impacts .
In order to avoid significant accidental debris creation , NASDA has implemented draining of residual propellants ( LOX , LH2 , N2H4 ) and the residual helium gas of the H-I / H-II second stage .
The release of mechanical devices at satellite separation and solar paddle deployment has been avoided except in some particular missions , such as the separation of spent apogee motor for the geostationary meteorological satellite .
For the purpose of the prevention of unintended destruction of the H-II second stage in space , the command destruct system is disabled immediately after injection into orbit and its pyrotechnics are thermally insulated to preclude spontaneous initiation .
The objects on the geostationary transfer orbits ( GTO ) are increasing and are considered to be hazardous to future space activities because of their long orbital life .
An effort is currently being made to decrease the orbital life of the second stage of the H-II.T. Ujino , I. Yamazaki , T. Nakagawa and K. Mori , &quot; Debris prevention plans of the H-II rocket &quot; , Proc . 44th IAF , IAF-93-V.5.633 , Graz , Austria ( Oct. 1993 ) .
The second stage ( 1994-056B ) of the H-II second flight of 28 August 1994 , for instance , was deorbited from the ETS-VI GTO with an apogee of 36,346 km and a perigee of 251 km to GTO with an apogee of 32,298 km and a perigee of 150 km by performing idle mode burn and the depletion of residual propellants .
It was observed that the second stage had fragmented into at least six new objects by 31 March 1995 and they have already decayed.N. Johnson , private communication ( April 1995 ) .
NASDA has also implemented reorbiting GEO satellites after the end of life ( EOL ) at least 150 km upward , aiming at 300 km since 1985 .
JSASS formed the committee on space debris prevention design standards in September 1993 at the request of NASDA .
The main objective is to discuss the technical backgrounds and to make a draft document for the &quot; NASDA Orbital Debris Mitigation Design Standards , &quot; which is to be established around 1997 .
The committee consists of members from the National Aerospace Laboratory ( NAL ) , ISAS , NASDA , universities and major space-related companies .
An extensive study on the technical and economical feasibility of space debris mitigation measures has been conducted placing emphasis on :
‚óè Spacecraft and rocket upper stage passivation ;
‚óè GTO upper stage deorbit ;
‚óè GEO satellite deorbit after EOL ; and
‚óè Other feasible and important measures , such as prevention of operational debris .
III . SPACE DEBRIS PROTECTION
Space debris protection systems have been studied by NASDA for JEM .
More than a hundred impact test data have been obtained in the impact velocity range of up to 5 km / s using a two-stage hydrogen light gas gun .
Hypervelocity impact experiments are important , not only for the design of space station protection systems , but also for the development of basic hypervelocity impact science and for understanding debris creation and dispersion phenomena .
A basic hypervelocity impact study has been conducted at NAL in collaboration with various organizations .
Impact experiments have been performed in various velocity ranges , that is , at around 2 km / s velocity with a one-stage powder gun at Kyoto University , at 4 km / s velocity with a two-stage helium gas gun at Tohoku University and at around 7 km / s with a rail gun at ISAS .
The target specimen was made of three aluminum alloy plates 3.5 mm thick which were set up with about 60 mm of space between each plate .
After the experiment it was noted that all three plates were perforated like a petal and that the petalled hole of the back plate was bigger than that of the front plate .
This illustrates that the two bumper plates before the main plate provided no protection against the debris impact with 14 g in mass and 2 km / s in collision velocity .
In order to investigate hypervelocity impact phenomena at velocities of up to 15 km / s , NAL has been conducting a collaborative study with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Limited on a shaped charge explosive launching system which is able to accelerate gram order mass aluminum projectiles to velocities of over 10 km / s .
A series of explosion experiments for modelling the breakup of a rocket upper stage is also planned .
IV . CONCLUSIONS
The preservation of the space environment is indispensable for insuring long-lasting and expanding space activities .
Various scientific and technical proposals have been made so far , and they would necessitate , more or less , additional costs and the reduction of space system capabilities .
What is needed is to identify acceptable technically effective and cost-efficient measures .
The most critical uncertainties in space debris problems are due to our ignorance of the exact space debris environment .
The cooperative efforts of Japan with other space-faring nations and organizations are required to examine the debris population , to accumulate hard data for verifying various theories and proposals , and to evaluate various measures and the associated penalties .

In March 1995 and November 1995 the British National Space Centre ( BNSC ) continued its discussions with the national space agencies of France ( CNES ) , Germany ( DARA ) , and Italy ( ASI ) and the European Space Agency ( ESA ) on harmonisation of debris activities .
The topics covered were technical objectives , operational requirements , the results of completed and ongoing research studies , identification of future studies , coordination of activities and the search for a common policy on space debris mitigation .
BNSC coordinated the collection and processing of data relating to the activities and capabilities ( software tools and facilities ) of United Kingdom industry , academic institutions and government research centres .
The information was passed on to ESA for collation with descriptions from other member States .
A report summarizing this information will be published by ESA and made available to both member States and non-member States .

Amongst the topics discussed were short-term and long-term debris hazard modelling , ground-based optical and radar detection of debris objects , measurement of the micro-debris through the analysis of retrieved surfaces , and international initiatives relating to space debris .

INTRODUCTION
At its thirty-second session , the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space agreed that it would be desirable to compile information on various steps taken by space agencies for reducing the growth or damage potential of space debris and to encourage common acceptance of those steps by the international community , on a voluntary basis ( A / AC.105 / 605 , para . 80 ) .
That recommendation was endorsed by the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space at its thirty-eighth session.Official Records of the General Assembly , Fiftieth Session , Supplement No. 20 ( A / 50 / 20 ) , para . 76 .
The present report has been prepared by the Secretariat in response to this request and is based on information provided by Member States , as well as by national and international space organizations .
I. DEBRIS MITIGATION TECHNIQUES USED IN LAUNCH VEHICLES
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) of the United States of America established debris mitigation strategies in the early 1980s after observing that hypergolic upper stages would often explode some time after they had completed their mission .
The latent period would range from several weeks to as long as 16-27 years .
Examination of the design of the stages led to the identification of a number of potential failure modes , modes that could have led to the observed explosions .
In each case , the event occurred because of the stored energy in the flight performance residuals that had been on board at the termination of the launcher stage mission .
Since then , a number of different techniques have been used to burn or vent the stored propellants and pressurants and to open electrical circuits and batteries .
All United States launch systems execute some form of contamination and collision avoidance manoeuvres shortly after spacecraft separation .
In general , the components of the system for releasing the spacecraft remain with the upper stage .
The initial procedures to deplete stored energy were developed in 1981 , when it was observed that second stages of the Delta launcher would explode some time after completion of payload delivery .
Analysis indicated that with residual propellants , the nitrogen tetroxide and helium could be heated to temperatures that would generate pressure exceeding the strength of the material .
When the tank structure failed , the propellants ignited and the stage exploded .
The fragmentation of the second stage of Delta-111 on 1 May 1991 , after 16 years in orbit , supports this conclusion .
The second stage depletion burn was first implemented in September 1981 , just four months after the investigation had started .
No Delta stage that has followed stored energy depletion procedures has exploded since then .
In the case of the Centaur launcher , used on the Titan and the Atlas boosters for geosynchronous orbit missions , a collision avoidance manoeuvre is conducted so that the Centaur stage is boosted into a graveyard orbit above the geostationary arc .
In all cases , the engines are burned to depletion to preclude stored energy from inducing overpressure explosions .
After completion of the depletion burn , the pressurants are vented .
The last stage of the Titan launcher is normally disposed of by leaving it on a ballistic re-entry trajectory .
When the stage has a limited orbital lifetime , the commercial Titan-2 stage is modified so that it will not overpressurize during the period before atmospheric re-entry .
To date , this has been done by thermal control paints .
In more powerful versions of Titan-2 , which augment the lift capability by an array of solid rocket motor boosters on the first stage , procedures similar to those used by Delta will be adopted .
In the case of Titan-3 and Titan-4 , the second stage is burned to depletion after payload separation and the collision contamination avoidance manoeuvre is conducted , generally to de-orbit the stage .
The upper stage then has to take measures to minimize debris .
The predominant upper stage is the Centaur mentioned above .
The other United States upper stages that can be used , the payload assist module ( PAM-D2 ) , Transtage , inertial upper stage ( IUS ) and transfer orbit stage ( TOS ) , have not flown , or been scheduled to fly , since debris avoidance manoeuvres have been required , so no explicit procedures have been defined .
Transtage has restart capability , so it could use procedures similar to Delta or Centaur stages .
The others are all solid rocket motors and have limited capability to manoeuvre with attitude control system after payload separation .
The French space agency Centre national d &apos;√©tudes spatiales ( CNES ) , together with Arianespace , started residual fuel venting from the upper stage of the Ariane launcher in the case of launches into low-altitude circular orbits ( e.g. the satellite pour l &apos;observation de la Terre ( SPOT-2 ) , the European Remote Sensing Satellite ( ERS-1 ) and Topex / Poseidon satellites ) to prevent explosions .
Since flight V-59 , fuel venting of the third stage is routinely carried out regardless of the type of the target orbit .
Future CNES debris mitigation policies include the following :
( a ) The launcher may leave in orbit a maximum of one inert object ( debris ) per satellite launched ;
( b ) All objects left in orbit ( whatever the orbit may be ) must be made fully passive to prevent any further explosions after the end of the mission .
Active elements such as batteries or tanks containing residual propellant must reach a fully inert state after delivering the satellites to orbit ;
